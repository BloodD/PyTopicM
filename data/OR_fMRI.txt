Abstract: The brain stores information in an associative manner so that contextually related entities are connected in memory. Such associative representations mediate the brain's ability to generate predictions about which other objects and events to expect in a given context. Likewise, the brain encodes and is able to rapidly retrieve the affective value of stimuli in our environment. That both contextual associations and affect serve as building blocks of numerous mental functions often makes interpretation of brain activation ambiguous. A critical brain region where such activation has often resulted in equivocal interpretation is the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), which has been implicated separately in both affective and associative processing. To characterize its role more unequivocally, we tested whether activity in the mOFC was most directly attributable to affective processing, associative processing, or a combination of both. Subjects performed an object recognition task while undergoing fMRI scans. Objects varied independently in their affective valence and in their degree of association with other objects (associativity). Analyses revealed an overlapping sensitivity whereby the left mOFC responded both to increasingly positive affective value and to stronger associativity. These two properties individually accounted for mOFC response, even after controlling for their interrelationship. The role of the mOFC is either general enough to encompass associations that link stimuli both with reinforcing outcomes and with other stimuli or abstract enough to use both valence and associativity in conjunction to inform downstream processes related to perception and action. These results may further point to a fundamental relationship between associativity and positive affect.

Abstract: Recent fMRI studies suggest that cortical face processing extends well beyond the fusiform face area (FFA), including unspecified portions of the anterior temporal lobe. However, the exact location of such anterior temporal region(s), and their role during active face recognition, remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that (in addition to FFA) a small bilateral site in the anterior tip of the collateral sulcus ('AT'; the anterior temporal face patch) is selectively activated during recognition of faces but not houses (a non-face object). In contrast to the psychophysical prediction that inverted and contrast reversed faces are processed like other non-face objects, both FFA and AT (but not other visual areas) were also activated during recognition of inverted and contrast reversed faces. However, response accuracy was better correlated to recognition-driven activity in AT, compared to FFA. These data support a segregated, hierarchical model of face recognition processing, extending to the anterior temporal cortex.

Abstract: The integration of visual and haptic input can facilitate object recognition. Yet, vision might dominate visuo-haptic interactions as it is more effective than haptics in processing several object features in parallel and recognizing objects outside of reaching space. The maximum likelihood approach of multisensory integration would predict that haptics as the less efficient sense for object recognition gains more from integrating additional visual information than vice versa. To test for asymmetries between vision and touch in visuo-haptic interactions, we measured regional changes in brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging while healthy individuals performed a delayed-match-to-sample task. We manipulated identity matching of sample and target objects: We hypothesized that only coherent visual and haptic object features would activate unified object representations. The bilateral object-specific lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus showed increased activation to crossmodal compared to unimodal matching but only for congruent object pairs. Critically, the visuo-haptic interaction effects in these regions depended on the sensory modality which processed the target object, being more pronounced for haptic than visual targets. This preferential response of visuo-haptic regions indicates a modality-specific asymmetry in crossmodal matching of visual and haptic object features, suggesting a functional primacy of vision over touch in visuo-haptic object recognition.

Abstract: Previous lesion studies have shown compromised complex object discrimination in rats, monkeys, and human patients with damage to the perirhinal cortical region (PRC) of the medial temporal lobe. These findings support the notion that the PRC is involved in object discrimination when pairs of objects have a high degree of overlapping features but not when object discrimination can be resolved on the basis of a single feature (e.g., size or color). Recent studies have demonstrated age-related functional changes to the PRC in animals (rats and monkeys) resulting in impaired complex object discrimination and object recognition. To date, no studies have compared younger and older humans using paradigms previously shown to engage the PRC. To investigate the influence of age on complex object discrimination in humans, the present study used an object matching paradigm for blob-like objects that have previously been shown to recruit the PRC. Difficulty was manipulated by varying the number of overlapping features between objects. Functional MRI data was acquired to determine the involvement of the PRC in the two groups during complex object discrimination. Results indicated that while young and older adults performed similarly on the easy version of the task, most older adults were impaired relative to young participants when the number of overlapping features increased. fMRI results suggest that older adults do not engage bilateral anterior PRC to the same extent as young adults. Specifically, complex object matching performance in older adults was predicted by the degree to which they engage left anterior PRC. These results provide evidence for human age-related changes in PRC function that impact complex object discrimination. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Research has demonstrated that the perirhinal cortex (PRC) represents complex object-level feature configurations, and participates in familiarity versus novelty discrimination. Barense et al. [(in press) Cerebral Cortex, 22:11, doi:10.1093/cercor/bhr347] postulated that, in addition, the PRC modulates part familiarity responses in lower-level visual areas. We used fMRI to measure activation in the PRC and V2 in response to silhouettes presented peripherally while participants maintained central fixation and performed an object recognition task. There were three types of silhouettes: Familiar Configurations portrayed real-world objects; Part-Rearranged Novel Configurations created by spatially rearranging the parts of the familiar configurations; and Control Novel Configurations in which both the configuration and the ensemble of parts comprising it were novel. For right visual field (RVF) presentation, BOLD responses revealed a significant linear trend in bilateral BA 35 of the PRC (highest activation for Familiar Configurations, lowest for Part-Rearranged Novel Configurations, with Control Novel Configurations in between). For left visual field (LVF) presentation, a significant linear trend was found in a different area (bilateral BA 38, temporal pole) in the opposite direction (Part-Rearranged Novel Configurations highest, Familiar Configurations lowest). These data confirm that the PRC is sensitive to the agreement in familiarity between the configuration level and the part level. As predicted, V2 activation mimicked that of the PRC: for RVF presentation, activity in V2 was significantly higher in the left hemisphere for Familiar Configurations than for Part-Rearranged Novel Configurations, and for LVF presentation, the opposite effect was found in right hemisphere V2. We attribute these patterns in V2 to feedback from the PRC because receptive fields in V2 encompass parts but not configurations. These results reveal two new aspects of PRC function: (1) it is sensitive to the congruency between the familiarity of object configurations and the parts comprising those configurations and (2) it likely modulates familiarity responses in visual area V2.

Abstract: Impossible objects are defined as 2D drawings that represent objects that could not exist in real 3D space. Previous studies have proposed that such objects are represented differently in long-term memory due to their invalid spatial structure. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these discrepancies reflect early perceptual processes or late, post-recognition, processes. Here, we address this issue by using fMRI adaptation. Interestingly, equivalent adaptation levels were obtained for repeated compared to non-repeated possible and impossible objects in object selective regions within the human high-level visual cortex. Yet, a significant correlation between fMRI adaptation and behavioral facilitation was found for possible but not for impossible objects, thus exhibiting some dissociation in the representation of the two object categories. Overall, our findings suggest that the initial perception of possible and impossible objects is mediated by shared neural mechanisms whereas the observed differences between the two types of objects may reflect higher post-recognition processes.

Abstract: We compared electrocorticography (ECoG) with invasive intracranial noninvasive functional MRI using language-related tasks. Twenty patients underwent bilateral implantation of subdural electrodes (more than 80 channels) for diagnosing intractable epilepsy. Before implantation of the electrodes, language-related fMRI was performed, and the fMR images were superimposed on individual brain images. Brain mapping with electrocortical stimulation was performed on the basis of the fused fMR and brain MR images, and the specificity and sensitivity of language-related fMRI was calculated. For careful interpretation of spatial and temporal ECoG changes with semantic tasks, we developed a software to visualize semantic-ECoG dynamics in the brain. Semantic-ECoG was recorded during word, figure, and face recognition as well as memory tasks. The raw ECoG data were processed by averaging and time-frequency analysis, and the functional profiles were projected onto the individual brain surface. Acquired ECoG was classified using Support Vector Machine and Sparse Logistic Regression to decode brain signals. Because of variations in electrode locations, we normalized the ECoG electrodes by using SPM8. Although fMRI has 90% sensitivity, its specificity is only up to 50%. The basal temporal-occipital cortex was activated within 250 ms after visual object presentation. Compared to other stimuli, face stimulation evoked significantly higher ECoG amplitudes. Among different brain regions, the hippocampus was predominantly activated during the memory task. The prediction rate of ECoG classification was 90%, which was sufficient for clinical use. Semantic-ECoG is a powerful technique to detect and decode human brain functions.

Abstract: There is considerable evidence that there are anatomically and functionally distinct pathways for action and object recognition. However, little is known about how information about action and objects is integrated. This study provides fMRI evidence for task-based selection of brain regions associated with action and object processing, and on how the congruency between the action and the object modulates neural response. Participants viewed videos of objects used in congruent or incongruent actions and attended either to the action or the object in a one-back procedure. Attending to the action led to increased responses in a fronto-parietal action-associated network. Attending to the object activated regions within a fronto-inferior temporal network. Stronger responses for congruent action-object clips occurred in bilateral parietal, inferior temporal, and putamen. Distinct cortical and thalamic regions were modulated by congruency in the different tasks. The results suggest that (i) selective attention to action and object information is mediated through separate networks, (ii) object-action congruency evokes responses in action planning regions, and (iii) the selective activation of nuclei within the thalamus provides a mechanism to integrate task goals in relation to the congruency of the perceptual information presented to the observer.

Abstract: Our experience with the world commonly involves physical interaction with objects enabling us to learn associations between multisensory information perceived during an event and our actions that create an event. The interplay among active interactions during learning and multisensory integration of object properties is not well understood. To better understand how action might enhance multisensory associative recognition, we investigated the interplay among motor and perceptual systems after active learning. Fifteen participants were included in an fMRI study during which they learned visuo-auditory-motor associations between novel objects and the sounds they produce, either through self-generated actions on the objects (active learning) or by observing an experimenter produce the actions (passive learning). Immediately after learning, behavioral and BOLD fMRI measures were collected while perceiving the objects used during unisensory and multisensory training in associative perception and recognition tasks. Active learning was faster and led to more accurate recognition of audiovisual associations than passive learning. Functional ROI analyses showed that in motor, somatosensory, and cerebellar regions there was greater activation during both the perception and recognition of actively learned associations. Finally, functional connectivity between visual- and motor-related processing regions was enhanced during the presentation of actively learned audiovisual associations. Overall, the results of the current study clarify and extend our own previous work [Butler, A. J., James, T. W., & Harman James, K. Enhanced multisensory integration and motor reactivation after active motor learning of audiovisual associations. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 23, 3515-3528, 2011] by providing several novel findings and highlighting the task-based nature of motor reactivation and retrieval after active learning.

Abstract: Two experiments explored eye measures (fixations and pupil response patterns) and brain responses (BOLD) accompanying the recognition of visual object stimuli based on familiarity and recollection. In both experiments, the use of a modified remember/know procedure led to high confidence and matched accuracy levels characterising strong familiarity (F3) and recollection (R) responses. In Experiment 1, visual scanning behaviour at retrieval distinguished familiarity-based from recollection-based recognition. Recollection, relative to strength-matched familiarity, involved significantly larger pupil dilations and more dispersed fixation patterns. In Experiment 2, the hippocampus was selectively activated for recollected stimuli, while no evidence of activation was observed in the hippocampus for strong familiarity of matched accuracy. Recollection also activated the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), while the adjacent perirhinal cortex (PRC) was actively engaged in response to strong familiarity (than to recollection). Activity in prefrontal and parietal areas differentiated familiarity and recollection in both the extent and the magnitude of activity they exhibited, while the dorsomedial thalamus showed selective familiarity-related activity, and the ventrolateral and anterior thalamus selective recollection-related activity. These findings are consistent with the view that the hippocampus and PRC play contrasting roles in supporting recollection and familiarity and that these differences are not a result of differences in memory strength. Overall, the combined pupil dilation, eye movement and fMRI data suggest the operation of recognition mechanisms drawing differentially on familiarity and recollection, whose neural bases are distinct within the MTL.

Abstract: What are the brain mechanisms that mediate conscious object recognition? To investigate this question, it is essential to distinguish between brain processes that cause conscious recognition of a stimulus from other correlates of its sensory processing. Previous fMRI studies have identified large-scale brain activity ranging from striate to high-level sensory and prefrontal regions associated with conscious visual perception or recognition. However, the possible role of changes in connectivity during conscious perception between these regions has only rarely been studied. Here, we used fMRI and connectivity analyses, together with 120 custom-generated, two-tone, Mooney images to directly assess whether conscious recognition of an object is accompanied by a dynamical change in the functional coupling between extrastriate cortex and prefrontal areas. We compared recognizing an object versus not recognizing it in 19 naive subjects using two different response modalities. We find that connectivity between the extrastriate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) increases when objects are consciously recognized. This interaction was independent of the response modality used to report conscious recognition. Furthermore, computing the difference in Granger causality between recognized and not recognized conditions reveals stronger feedforward connectivity than feedback connectivity when subjects recognized the objects. We suggest that frontal and visual brain regions are part of a functional network that supports conscious object recognition by changes in functional connectivity.

Abstract: When we view an object, its appearance depends in large part on specific surface reflectance properties; among these is surface gloss, which provides important information about the material composition of the object and the fine structure of its surface. To study how gloss is represented in the visual cortical areas related to object recognition, we examined the responses of neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the macaque monkey to a set of object images exhibiting various combinations of specular reflection, diffuse reflection, and roughness, which are important physical parameters of surface gloss. We found that there are neurons in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus that selectively respond to specific gloss. This neuronal selectivity was largely maintained when the shape or illumination of the object was modified and perceived glossiness was unchanged. By contrast, neural responses were significantly altered when the pixels of the images were randomly rearranged, and perceived glossiness was dramatically changed. The stimulus preference of these neurons differed from cell to cell, and, as a population, they systematically represented a variety of surface glosses. We conclude that, within the visual cortex, there are mechanisms operating to integrate local image features and extract information about surface gloss and that this information is systematically represented in the IT cortex, an area playing an important role in object recognition.

Abstract: We used an identical repetition priming paradigm in functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate brain networks modulated by stimulus repetition and familiarity. In particular, pictures of familiar or unfamiliar objects were presented sequentially, with stimulus repetitions occurring within few trials. The results of both studies indicated close agreement between the pattern found in fMRI-BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) responses and in source localizations of induced gamma-band activity derived from MEG. In both studies, the brain regions that were significantly associated with repetition suppression in response to familiar visual objects encompassed bilaterally the medial and lateral occipital cortex, inferior occipitotemporal regions including the left fusiform cortex, as well as parietal areas. Modulations by stimulus familiarity occurred mainly within this network. Overall, we found noticeable correspondences between the results of fMRI-BOLD signals and MEG gamma-band activity, suggesting that both methods can be used in analogous ways to study the neural basis of repetition priming and object recognition.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging systems usually feature linear and shift-invariant (stationary) transform characteristics. The point spread function or equivalently the modulation transfer function may thus be used for an objective quality assessment of imaging modalities. The recently introduced theory of compressed sensing, however, incorporates nonlinear and nonstationary reconstruction algorithms into the magnetic resonance imaging process which prohibits the usage of the classical point spread function and therefore the according evaluation. METHODS: In this work, a local point spread function concept was applied to assess the quality of magnetic resonance images which were reconstructed by an iterative soft thresholding algorithm for compressed sensing. The width of the main lobe of the local point spread function was used to perform studies on the spatial and temporal resolution properties of both numerical phantom and in vivo images. The impact of k-space sampling patterns as well as additional sparsifying transforms on the local spatial image resolution was investigated. In addition, the local temporal resolution of image series, which were reconstructed by exploiting spatiotemporal sparsity, was determined. Finally, the dependency of the local resolution on the thresholding parameter of the algorithm was examined. RESULTS: The sampling patterns as well as the additional sparsifying transform showed a distinct impact on the local image resolution of the phantom image. The reconstructions, which were using x-f-space as a sparse transform domain showed slight temporal blurring for dynamic parts of the imaged object. The local image resolution had a dependence on the thresholding parameter, which allowed for optimizing the reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Local point spread functions enable the evaluation of the local spatial and temporal resolution of images reconstructed with the nonlinear and nonstationary iterative soft thresholding algorithm. By determining the influence of thresholding parameter and sampling pattern chosen on this model-based reconstruction, the method allows selecting appropriate acquisition parameters and thus improving the results.

Abstract: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The potential of robot-mediated therapy and virtual reality in neurorehabilitation is becoming of increasing importance. However, there is limited information, using neuroimaging, on the neural networks involved in training with these technologies. This study was intended to detect the brain network involved in the visual processing of movement during robotic training. The main aim was to investigate the existence of a common cerebral network able to assimilate biological (human upper limb) and non-biological (abstract object) movements, hence testing the suitability of the visual non-biological feedback provided by the InMotion2 Robot. METHODS: A visual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) task was administered to 22 healthy subjects. The task required observation and retrieval of motor gestures and of the visual feedback used in robotic training. Functional activations of both biological and non-biological movements were examined to identify areas activated in both conditions, along with differential activity in upper limb vs. abstract object trials. Control of response was also tested by administering trials with congruent and incongruent reaching movements. RESULTS: The observation of upper limb and abstract object movements elicited similar patterns of activations according to a caudo-rostral pathway for the visual processing of movements (including specific areas of the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes). Similarly, overlapping activations were found for the subsequent retrieval of the observed movement. Furthermore, activations of frontal cortical areas were associated with congruent trials more than with the incongruent ones. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the neural pathway associated with visual processing of movement stimuli used in upper limb robot-mediated training and investigated the brain's ability to assimilate abstract object movements with human motor gestures. In both conditions, activations were elicited in cerebral areas involved in visual perception, sensory integration, recognition of movement, re-mapping on the somatosensory and motor cortex, storage in memory, and response control. Results from the congruent vs. incongruent trials revealed greater activity for the former condition than the latter in a network including cingulate cortex, right inferior and middle frontal gyrus that are involved in the go-signal and in decision control. Results on healthy subjects would suggest the appropriateness of an abstract visual feedback provided during motor training. The task contributes to highlight the potential of fMRI in improving the understanding of visual motor processes and may also be useful in detecting brain reorganisation during training.

Abstract: Using fMRI, this study examined the relationship between repetition-related changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation during encoding and subsequent memory for similarity of repetitions. During scanning, subjects classified pictures of objects as natural or man-made. Each object-type was judged twice with presentations of either identical pictures or pictures of different exemplars of the same object. After scanning, a surprise recognition test required subjects to decide whether a probe word corresponded to pictures judged previously. When a subject judged the word as "old," a second judgment was made concerning the physical similarity of the two pictures. Repetition related changes in MTL activation varied depending on whether or not subjects could correctly state that pictures were different. Moreover, psychophysiological interactions analyses showed that accuracy in recalling whether the two pictures were different was predicted by repetition-related changes in the functional connectivity of MTL with frontal regions. Specifically, correct recollection was predicted by increased connectivity between the left posterior hippocampus and the right inferior frontal gyrus, and also by decreased connectivity between the left posterior hippocampus and the left precentral gyrus on the second stimulus presentation. The opposite pattern was found for trials that were incorrectly judged on the nature of the repetition. These results suggest that successful encoding is predicted by a combination of increases and decreases in both the MTL activation and functional connectivity, and not merely by increases in activation and connectivity as suggested previously.

Abstract: Memory and perception have long been considered separate cognitive processes, and amnesia resulting from medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage is thought to reflect damage to a dedicated memory system. Recent work has questioned these views, suggesting that amnesia can result from impoverished perceptual representations in the MTL, causing an increased susceptibility to interference. Using a perceptual matching task for which fMRI implicated a specific MTL structure, the perirhinal cortex, we show that amnesics with MTL damage including the perirhinal cortex, but not those with damage limited to the hippocampus, were vulnerable to object-based perceptual interference. Importantly, when we controlled such interference, their performance recovered to normal levels. These findings challenge prevailing conceptions of amnesia, suggesting that effects of damage to specific MTL regions are better understood not in terms of damage to a dedicated declarative memory system, but in terms of impoverished representations of the stimuli those regions maintain.

Abstract: To gain an understanding of object recognition, it is important to identify the neural basis for object recognition. In this review, I have attempted to explain which neural structures are involved in these functions, and how these structures are organized within the brain. Electrophysiological and optical imaging studies suggest that object images are represented by a combination of the columnar activities in the monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Each column represents a visual feature of the object. However, fMRI studies have extracted category-specific activity patches that were formed by neurons responding to the specific object category. These studies suggest that there are 2 functional organization levels, which represent object images and categories in IT cortex. Recently, dense electrophysiological mapping was conducted in a wide range of IT cortex. The results showed that columns that have similar object selectivity are located close to each other, forming functional domains. The selectivity of some domains was related to object category. In a domain found to be selective for faces, columns within the domain showed variability in their selectivity for finer categories, such as human faces or monkey faces. These findings suggest that there are hierarchical functional structures that represent object images and categories. Both structures were embedded in the same IT cortex.

Abstract: A critical issue in object recognition research is how the parts of an object are analyzed by the visual system and combined into a perceptual whole. However, most of the previous research has examined how changes to object parts influence recognition of the whole, rather than recognition of the parts themselves. This is particularly true of the research on face recognition, and especially with questions related to the neural substrates. Here, we investigated patterns of BOLD fMRI brain activation with internal face parts (features) presented singly and in different combinations. A preference for single features over combinations was found in the occipital face area (OFA) as well as a preference for the two-eyes combination stimulus over other combination stimulus types. The fusiform face area (FFA) and lateral occipital cortex (LO) showed no preferences among the single feature and combination stimulus types. The results are consistent with a growing view that the OFA represents processes involved in early, feature-based analysis.

Abstract: Patients with schizophrenia exhibit cognitive and sensory impairment, and object recognition deficits have been linked to sensory deficits. The "frame and fill" model of object recognition posits that low spatial frequency (LSF) information rapidly reaches the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and creates a general shape of an object that feeds back to the ventral temporal cortex to assist object recognition. Visual dysfunction findings in schizophrenia suggest a preferential loss of LSF information. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) to investigate the contribution of visual deficits to impaired object "framing" circuitry in schizophrenia. Participants were shown object stimuli that were intact or contained only LSF or high spatial frequency (HSF) information. For controls, fMRI revealed preferential activation to LSF information in precuneus, superior temporal, and medial and dorsolateral PFC areas, whereas patients showed a preference for HSF information or no preference. RSFC revealed a lack of connectivity between early visual areas and PFC for patients. These results demonstrate impaired processing of LSF information during object recognition in schizophrenia, with patients instead displaying increased processing of HSF information. This is consistent with findings of a preference for local over global visual information in schizophrenia.

Abstract: Theoretical studies suggest that the visual system uses prior knowledge of visual objects to recognize them in visual clutter, and posit that the strategies for recognizing objects in clutter may differ depending on whether or not the object was learned in clutter to begin with. We tested this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of human subjects. We trained subjects to recognize naturalistic, yet novel objects in strong or weak clutter. We then tested subjects' recognition performance for both sets of objects in strong clutter. We found many brain regions that were differentially responsive to objects during object recognition depending on whether they were learned in strong or weak clutter. In particular, the responses of the left fusiform gyrus (FG) reliably reflected, on a trial-to-trial basis, subjects' object recognition performance for objects learned in the presence of strong clutter. These results indicate that the visual system does not use a single, general-purpose mechanism to cope with clutter. Instead, there are two distinct spatial patterns of activation whose responses are attributable not to the visual context in which the objects were seen, but to the context in which the objects were learned.

Abstract: Although expectation- and attention-related interactions between ventral and medial prefrontal cortex and stimulus category-selective visual regions have been identified during visual detection and discrimination, it is not known if similar neural mechanisms apply to other tasks such as visual search. The current work tested the hypothesis that high-level frontal regions, previously implicated in expectation and visual imagery of object categories, interact with visual regions associated with object recognition during visual search. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects searched for a specific object that varied in size and location within a complex natural scene. A model-free, spatial-independent component analysis isolated multiple task-related components, one of which included visual cortex, as well as a cluster within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), consistent with the engagement of both top-down and bottom-up processes. Analyses of psychophysiological interactions showed increased functional connectivity between vmPFC and object-sensitive lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and results from dynamic causal modeling and Bayesian Model Selection suggested bidirectional connections between vmPFC and LOC that were positively modulated by the task. Using image-guided diffusion-tensor imaging, functionally seeded, probabilistic white-matter tracts between vmPFC and LOC, which presumably underlie this effective interconnectivity, were also observed. These connectivity findings extend previous models of visual search processes to include specific frontal-occipital neuronal interactions during a natural and complex search task.

Abstract: The new trend in brain research designated as brain reading is considered. This research deals with decoding the informational content of the brain processing via its physiological parameters. Such studies are based on rather complicated methods of mathematical analysis. Single records rather than averaged data are used to reveal their content. Three main streams of studies are distinguished, i.e. the object classification, the emotion recognition and brainotyping. Particularly, the studies directed to recognizing the type of thinking via EEG spectra, carried out in the author's laboratory, are reviewed. The possible outcome of the brain reading technique is considered. Finally it is argued that in the future, the broad application of this technique needs to be controlled with some ethical rules.

Abstract: Long-term memory integrates the multimodal information acquired through perception into unified concepts, supporting object recognition, thought, and language. While some theories of human cognition have considered concepts to be abstract symbols, recent functional neuroimaging evidence has supported an alternative theory: that concepts are multimodal representations associated with the sensory and motor systems through which they are acquired. However, few studies have examined the effects of cortical lesions on the sensory and motor associations of concepts. We tested the hypothesis that individuals with disease in auditory association cortex would have difficulty processing concepts with strong sound associations (e.g., thunder). Human participants with the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) performed a recognition task on words with strong associations in three modalities: Sound, Sight, and Manipulation. LvPPA participants had selective difficulty on Sound words relative to other modalities. Structural MRI analysis in lvPPA revealed gray matter atrophy in auditory association cortex, as defined functionally in a separate BOLD fMRI study of healthy adults. Moreover, lvPPA showed reduced gray matter density in the region of auditory association cortex that healthy participants activated when processing the same Sound words in a separate BOLD fMRI experiment. Finally, reduced gray matter density in this region in lvPPA directly correlated with impaired performance on Sound words. These findings support the hypothesis that conceptual memories are represented in the sensory and motor association cortices through which they are acquired.

Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD) demonstrated short-term neuroprotective effects in the immature brain following hypoxia-ischemia (HI). We examined whether CBD neuroprotection is sustained over a prolonged period. Newborn Wistar rats underwent HI injury (10% oxygen for 120 min after left carotid artery electrocoagulation) and then received vehicle (HV, n = 22) or 1 mg/kg CBD (HC, n = 23). Sham animals were similarly treated (SV, n = 16 and SC, n = 16). The extent of brain damage was determined by magnetic resonance imaging, histological evaluation (neuropathological score, 0-5), magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Western blotting. Several neurobehavioral tests (RotaRod, cylinder rear test[CRT],and novel object recognition[NOR]) were carried out 30 days after HI (P37). CBD modulated brain excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation seven days after HI. We observed that HI led to long-lasting functional impairment, as observed in all neurobehavioral tests at P37, whereas the results of HC animals were similar to those of sham animals (all p < 0.05 vs. HV). CBD reduced brain infarct volume by 17% (p < 0.05) and lessened the extent of histological damage. No differences were observed between the SV and SC groups in any of the experiments. In conclusion, CBD administration after HI injury to newborn rats led to long-lasting neuroprotection, with the overall effect of promoting greater functional rather than histological recovery. These effects of CBD were not associated with any side effects. These results emphasize the interest in CBD as a neuroprotective agent for neonatal HI.

Abstract: Object recognition in the peripheral visual field is limited by crowding: the disruptive influence of nearby clutter. Despite its severity, little is known about the cortical locus of crowding. Here, we examined the neural correlates of crowding by combining event-related fMRI adaptation with a change-detection paradigm. Crowding can change the appearance of objects, such that items become perceptually matched to surrounding objects; we used this change in appearance as a signature of crowding and measured brain activity that correlated with the crowded percept. Observers adapted to a peripheral patch of noise surrounded by four Gabor flankers. When crowded, the noise appears oriented and perceptually indistinguishable from the flankers. Consequently, substitution of the noise for a Gabor identical to the flankers ("change-same") is rarely detected, whereas substitution for an orthogonal Gabor ("change-different") is rarely missed. We predicted that brain areas representing the crowded percept would show repetition suppression in change-same trials but release from adaptation in change-different trials. This predicted pattern was observed throughout cortical visual areas V1-V4, increasing in strength from early to late visual areas. These results depict crowding as a multistage process, involving even the earliest cortical visual areas, with perceptual consequences that are increasingly influenced by later visual areas.

Abstract: Our visual system can extract summary statistics from large collections of similar objects without forming detailed representations of the individual objects in the ensemble. Such object ensemble representation is adaptive and allows us to overcome the capacity limitation associated with representing specific objects. Surprisingly, little is known about the neural mechanisms supporting such object ensemble representation. Here we showed human observers identical photographs of the same object ensemble, different photographs depicting the same ensemble, or different photographs depicting different ensembles. We observed fMRI adaptation in anterior-medial ventral visual cortex whenever object ensemble statistics repeated, even when local image features differed across photographs. Interestingly, such object ensemble processing is closely related to texture and scene processing in the brain. In contrast, the lateral occipital area, a region involved in object-shape processing, showed adaptation only when identical photographs were repeated. These results provide the first step toward understanding the neural underpinnings of real-world object ensemble representation.

Abstract: Neural processes for naturalistic drawing might be discerned into object recognition and analysis, attention processes guiding eye hand interaction, encoding of visual features in an allocentric reference frame, a transfer into the motor command and precise motor guidance with tight sensorimotor feedback. Cerebral representations in a real life paradigm during naturalistic drawing have sparsely been investigated. Using a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) paradigm we measured 20 naive subjects during drawing a portrait from a frontal face presented as a photograph. Participants were asked to draw the portrait in either a naturalistic or a sketchy characteristic way. Tracing the contours of the face with a pencil or passive viewing of the face served as control conditions. Compared to passive viewing, naturalistic and sketchy drawing recruited predominantly the dorsal visual pathway, somatosensory and motor areas and bilateral BA 44. The right occipital lobe, middle temporal (MT) and the fusiform face area were increasingly active during drawing compared to passive viewing as well. Compared to tracing with a pencil, both drawing tasks increasingly involved the bilateral precuneus together with the cuneus and right inferior temporal lobe. Overall, our study identified cerebral areas characteristic for previously proposed aspects of drawing: face perception and analysis (fusiform gyrus and higher visual areas), encoding and retrieval of locations in an allocentric reference frame (precuneus), and continuous feedback processes during motor output (parietal sulcus, cerebellar hemisphere).

Abstract: In order to adequately explore the neurobiological basis of eating behavior of humans and their changes with body weight, interactions between brain areas or networks need to be investigated. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined the modulating effects of stimulus category (food vs. nonfood), caloric content of food, and body weight on the time course and functional connectivity of 5 brain networks by means of independent component analysis in healthy lean and overweight/obese adults. These functional networks included motor sensory, default-mode, extrastriate visual, temporal visual association, and salience networks. We found an extensive modulation elicited by food stimuli in the 2 visual and salience networks, with a dissociable pattern in the time course and functional connectivity between lean and overweight/obese subjects. Specifically, only in lean subjects, the temporal visual association network was modulated by the stimulus category and the salience network by caloric content, whereas overweight and obese subjects showed a generalized augmented response in the salience network. Furthermore, overweight/obese subjects showed changes in functional connectivity in networks important for object recognition, motivational salience, and executive control. These alterations could potentially lead to top-down deficiencies driving the overconsumption of food in the obese population.

Abstract: Visual information is processed in the brain primarily through two distinct pathways, the dorsal and the ventral visual streams. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated the specialization and integration of dorsal and ventral streams using tasks of object recognition and location detection. The study included 22 healthy adult volunteers who viewed stimuli consisting of grayscale photographs of common household objects presented in blocked design. Participants were asked to either recognize an object or to locate its position. While the location detection task elicited greater activation in the dorsal visual stream, recognizing objects showed greater activation in the middle occipital gyri, left inferior temporal gyrus, and in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The integration between dorsal and ventral brain areas was stronger during location detection than during object recognition. In addition, a principal components analysis found preliminary evidence for a group of regions, such as frontal and parietal cortex, working together in this task. Overall, the results of this study indicate the existence of specialized modules for object recognition and location detection, and possible interactions between areas beyond the visual cortex that may play a role in such tasks.

Abstract: The characteristics of early and mild disease in primary progressive aphasia are poorly understood. This report is based on 25 patients with aphasia quotients >85%, 13 of whom were within 2 years of symptom onset. Word-finding and spelling deficits were the most frequent initial signs. Diagnostic imaging was frequently negative and initial consultations seldom reached a correct diagnosis. Functionality was preserved, so that the patients fit current criteria for single-domain mild cognitive impairment. One goal was to determine whether recently published classification guidelines could be implemented at these early and mild disease stages. The quantitative testing of the recommended core and ancillary criteria led to the classification of approximately 80% of the sample into agrammatic, logopenic and semantic variants. Biological validity of the resultant classification at these mild impairment stages was demonstrated by clinically concordant cortical atrophy patterns. A two-dimensional template based on orthogonal mapping of word comprehension and grammaticality provided comparable accuracy and led to a flexible road map that can guide the classification process quantitatively or qualitatively. Longitudinal evaluations of initially unclassifiable patients showed that the semantic variant can be preceded by a prodromal stage of focal left anterior temporal atrophy during which prominent anomia exists without word comprehension or object recognition impairments. Patterns of quantitative tests justified the distinction of grammar from speech abnormalities and the desirability of using the 'agrammatic' designation exclusively for loss of grammaticality, regardless of fluency or speech status. Two patients with simultaneous impairments of grammatical sentence production and word comprehension displayed focal atrophy of the inferior frontal gyrus and the anterior temporal lobe. These patients represent a fourth variant of 'mixed' primary progressive aphasia. Quantitative criteria were least effective in the distinction of the agrammatic from the logopenic variant and left considerable latitude to clinical judgement. The widely followed recommendation to wait for 2 years of relatively isolated and progressive language impairment before making a definitive diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia has promoted diagnostic specificity, but has also diverted attention away from early and mild disease. This study shows that this recommendation is unnecessarily restrictive and that quantitative guidelines can be implemented for the valid root diagnosis and subtyping of mildly impaired patients within 2 years of symptom onset. An emphasis on early diagnosis will promote a better characterization of the disease stages where therapeutic interventions are the most likely to succeed.

Abstract: Perception of known patterns results from the interaction of current sensory input with existing internal representations. It is unclear how perceptual and mnemonic processes interact when visual input is dynamic and structured such that it does not allow immediate recognition of obvious objects and forms. In an fMRI experiment, meaningful visual motion stimuli depicting movement through a virtual tunnel and indistinct, meaningless visual motion stimuli, achieved through phase scrambling of the same stimuli, were presented while participants performed an optic flow task. We found that our indistinct visual motion stimuli evoked hippocampal activation, whereas the corresponding meaningful stimuli did not. Using independent component analysis, we were able to demonstrate a functional connectivity between the hippocampus and early visual areas, with increased activity for indistinct stimuli. In a second experiment, we used the same stimuli to test whether our results depended on the participants' task. We found task-independent bilateral hippocampal activation in response to indistinct motion stimuli. For both experiments, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed a coupling from posterior hippocampus to dorsal visuospatial and ventral visual object processing areas when viewing indistinct stimuli. These results indicate a close functional link between stimulus-dependent perceptual and mnemonic processes. The observed pattern of hippocampal functional connectivity, in the absence of an explicit memory task, suggests that cortical-hippocampal networks are recruited when visual stimuli are temporally uncertain and do not immediately reveal a clear meaning.

Abstract: Object manipulation produces characteristic sounds and causes specific haptic sensations that facilitate the recognition of the manipulated object. To identify the neural correlates of audio-haptic binding of object features, healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they matched a target object to a sample object within and across audition and touch. By introducing a delay between the presentation of sample and target stimuli, it was possible to dissociate haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching. We hypothesized that only semantically coherent auditory and haptic object features activate cortical regions that host unified conceptual object representations. The left fusiform gyrus (FG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) showed increased activation during crossmodal matching of semantically congruent but not incongruent object stimuli. In the FG, this effect was found for haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching, whereas the pSTS only displayed a crossmodal matching effect for congruent auditory targets. Auditory and somatosensory association cortices showed increased activity during crossmodal object matching which was, however, independent of semantic congruency. Together, the results show multisensory interactions at different hierarchical stages of auditory and haptic object processing. Object-specific crossmodal interactions culminate in the left FG, which may provide a higher order convergence zone for conceptual object knowledge.

Abstract: In this study a modified Live-Wire approach is presented. A Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering procedure has been implemented before the wavelet transform cost map function is defined. This shrinks the area to be searched resulting in a significant reduction of the computational complexity. The method has been employed to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) studies. The 2D segmentation of lungs, abdominal structures and knee joint has been performed in order to evaluate the method. Significant numerical complexity reduction of the Live-Wire algorithm as well as improvement of the object delineation with a decreased number of user interactions have been obtained.

Abstract: Threatening stimuli have been found to modulate visual processes related to perception and attention. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated whether threat modulates visual object recognition of man-made and naturally occurring categories of stimuli. Compared with nonthreatening pictures, threatening pictures of real items elicited larger fMRI BOLD signal changes in medial visual cortices extending inferiorly into the temporo-occipital (TO) "what" pathways. This region elicited greater signal changes for threatening items compared to nonthreatening from both the natural-occurring and man-made stimulus supraordinate categories, demonstrating a featural component to these visual processing areas. Two additional loci of signal changes within more lateral inferior TO areas (bilateral BA18 and 19 as well as the right ventral temporal lobe) were detected for a category-feature interaction, with stronger responses to man-made (category) threatening (feature) stimuli than to natural threats. The findings are discussed in terms of visual recognition of processing efficiently or rapidly groups of items that confer an advantage for survival. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

Abstract: For humans, daily life is characterized by routine interaction with many different tools for which corresponding actions are specified and performed according to well-learned procedures. The current study used functional MRI (fMRI) repetition suppression (RS) to identify brain areas underlying the transformation of visually defined tool properties to corresponding motor programs for conventional use. Before grasping and demonstrating how to use a specific tool, participants passively viewed either the same (repeated) tool or a different (non-repeated) tool. Repetition of tools led to reduced fMRI signals (RS) within a selective network of parietal and premotor areas. Comparison with newly learned, arbitrarily defined control actions revealed specificity of RS for tool use, thought to reflect differences in the extent of previous sensorimotor experience. The findings indicate that familiar tools are visually represented within the same sensorimotor areas underlying their dexterous use according to learned properties defined by previous experience. This interpretation resonates with the broader concept of affordance specification considered fundamental to action planning and execution whereby action-relevant object properties (affordances) are visually represented in sensorimotor areas. The current findings extend this view to reveal that affordance specification in humans includes learned object properties defined by previous sensorimotor experience. From an evolutionary perspective, the neural mechanisms identified in the current study offer clear survival advantage, providing fast efficient transformation of visual information to appropriate motor responses based on previous experience.

Abstract: Prior semantic processing can enhance subsequent picture naming performance, yet the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying this effect and its longevity are unknown. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined whether different neurological mechanisms underlie short-term (within minutes) and long-term (within days) facilitation effects from a semantic task in healthy older adults. Both short- and long-term facilitated items were named significantly faster than unfacilitated items, with short-term items significantly faster than long-term items. Region of interest results identified decreased activity for long-term facilitated items compared to unfacilitated and short-term facilitated items in the mid-portion of the middle temporal gyrus, indicating lexical-semantic priming. Additionally, in the whole brain results, increased activity for short-term facilitated items was identified in regions previously linked to episodic memory and object recognition, including the right lingual gyrus (extending to the precuneus region) and the left inferior occipital gyrus (extending to the left fusiform region). These findings suggest that distinct neurocognitive mechanisms underlie short- and long-term facilitation of picture naming by a semantic task, with long-term effects driven by lexical-semantic priming and short-term effects by episodic memory and visual object recognition mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in Computer Vision and Experimental Neuroscience provided insights into mechanisms underlying invariant object recognition. However, due to the different research aims in both fields models tended to evolve independently. A tighter integration between computational and empirical work may contribute to cross-fertilized development of (neurobiologically plausible) computational models and computationally defined empirical theories, which can be incrementally merged into a comprehensive brain model. After reviewing theoretical and empirical work on invariant object perception, this article proposes a novel framework in which neural network activity and measured neuroimaging data are interfaced in a common representational space. This enables direct quantitative comparisons between predicted and observed activity patterns within and across multiple stages of object processing, which may help to clarify how high-order invariant representations are created from low-level features. Given the advent of columnar-level imaging with high-resolution fMRI, it is time to capitalize on this new window into the brain and test which predictions of the various object recognition models are supported by this novel empirical evidence.

Abstract: The ability to recognize objects across different viewpoints (view invariance) is a remarkable property of the primate visual system. According to a prominent theory, view information is represented by view-selective mechanisms at early stages of visual processing and gradually becomes view invariant in high-level visual areas. Single-cell recording studies have also reported an intermediate step of partial view invariance for mirror-symmetric face views. Nevertheless, similar evidence for this type of hierarchical processing for face view has not been reported yet in the human visual cortex. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study used state-of-the-art multivariate pattern analysis to explore face-view tuning in the human visual cortex. Our results revealed that consistent with a view-selective representation, face view can be successfully decoded in face and object-selective regions as well as in early visual cortex. Critically, similar neural representations for mirror-symmetric views were found in high-level but not in low-level visual areas. Our results support the notion of gradual emergence of view-invariant representation with invariance for mirror-symmetric images as an intermediate step and propose putative neural correlates of mirror-image confusion in the human brain.

Abstract: The semantic richness dimension referred to as body-object interaction (BOI) measures perceptions of the ease with which people can physically interact with words' referents. Previous studies have shown facilitated lexical and semantic processing for words rated high in BOI, e.g., belt, than for words rated low in BOI, e.g., sun. These BOI effects have been taken as evidence that embodied information is relevant to word recognition (Siakaluk et al., 2008a). However, to date there is no evidence linking BOI manipulations to differences in the utilization of perceptual or sensorimotor areas of the brain. The current study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of BOI in a semantic categorization task (SCT). Sixteen healthy adults participated. Results showed that high BOI words were associated with activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (supramarginal gyrus, BA 40), a sensory association area involved in kinesthetic memory. These results provide evidence that the BOI dimension captures the relative availability of sensorimotor information, and that this contributes to semantic processing.

Abstract: Knowledge about the principles that govern large-scale neural representations of objects is central to a systematic understanding of object recognition. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern classification to investigate two such candidate principles: category preference and location encoding. The former designates the preferential activation of distinct cortical regions by a specific category of objects. The latter refers to information about where in the visual field a particular object is located. Participants viewed exemplars of three object categories (faces, bodies, and scenes) that were presented left or right of fixation. The analysis of fMRI activation patterns revealed the following. Category-selective regions retained their preference to the same categories in a manner tolerant to changes in object location. However, category preference was not absolute: category-selective regions also contained location-tolerant information about nonpreferred categories. Furthermore, location information was present throughout high-level ventral visual cortex and was distributed systematically across the cortical surface. We found more location information in lateral-occipital cortex than in ventral-temporal cortex. Our results provide a systematic account of the extent to which the principles of category preference and location encoding determine the representation of objects in the high-level ventral visual cortex.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Overt repetition of auditorily presented words can facilitate picture naming performance in both unimpaired speakers and individuals with word retrieval difficulties, but the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and longevity of such effects remain unclear. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether different neurological mechanisms underlie short-term (within minutes) and long-term (within days) facilitation effects from an auditory repetition task in healthy older adults. RESULTS: The behavioral results showed that both short- and long-term facilitated items were named significantly faster than unfacilitated items, with short-term items significantly faster than long-term items. Neuroimaging analyses identified a repetition suppression effect for long-term facilitated items, relative to short-term facilitated and unfacilitated items, in regions known to be associated with both semantic and phonological processing. A repetition suppression effect was also observed for short-term facilitated items when compared to unfacilitated items in a region of the inferior temporal lobe linked to semantic processing and object recognition, and a repetition enhancement effect when compared to long-term facilitated items in a posterior superior temporal region associated with phonological processing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that different neurocognitive mechanisms underlie short- and long-term facilitation of picture naming by an auditory repetition task, reflecting both phonological and semantic processing. More specifically, the brain areas engaged were consistent with the view that long-term facilitation may be driven by a strengthening of semantic-phonological connections. Short-term facilitation, however, appears to result in more efficient semantic processing and/or object recognition, possibly in conjunction with active recognition of the phonological form.

Abstract: Evidence of category specificity from neuroimaging in the human visual system is generally limited to a few relatively coarse categorical distinctions-e.g., faces versus bodies, or animals versus artifacts-leaving unknown the neural underpinnings of fine-grained category structure within these large domains. Here we use fMRI to explore brain activity for a set of categories within the animate domain, including six animal species-two each from three very different biological classes: primates, birds, and insects. Patterns of activity throughout ventral object vision cortex reflected the biological classes of the stimuli. Specifically, the abstract representational space-measured as dissimilarity matrices defined between species-specific multivariate patterns of brain activity-correlated strongly with behavioral judgments of biological similarity of the same stimuli. This biological class structure was uncorrelated with structure measured in retinotopic visual cortex, which correlated instead with a dissimilarity matrix defined by a model of V1 cortex for the same stimuli. Additionally, analysis of the shape of the similarity space in ventral regions provides evidence for a continuum in the abstract representational space-with primates at one end and insects at the other. Further investigation into the cortical topography of activity that contributes to this category structure reveals the partial engagement of brain systems active normally for inanimate objects in addition to animate regions.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Dorsal pathway dysfunctions are thought to underlie visuospatial processing problems in Alzheimer disease (AD). Prior studies reported compensatory mechanisms in the dorsal or ventral pathway in response to these functional changes. Since functional and structural connectivity are interrelated, these functional changes could be interpreted as a disconnection between both pathways. To better understand functional alterations in the dorsal pathway, we combined functional imaging with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a likely prodromal stage of AD. METHODS: Eighteen older male individuals with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 18 male cognitively healthy individuals, matched for age (range 59-75years) and education, performed an object recognition task in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Neural activation was measured during recognition of non-canonically versus canonically oriented objects. Regions showing activation differences between groups were also investigated by DTI. RESULTS: Recognition of non-canonical objects elicited increased frontal, temporal and parietal activation. Combining the functional MRI (fMRI) with the DTI results showed less deactivation in areas with decreased diffusion (mediolateral parietal and orbitofrontal) and increased activation in areas with increased diffusion (parietal and temporal) in aMCI patients. Finally, in aMCI patients decreased diffusion was found in the hippocampal cingulum, connecting both pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed increased activation in early AD patients in ventral and dorsal pathways. A decrease in deactivation and diffusion suggests functional reorganization, while increased activation and diffusion suggests compensatory processes. This is the first study showing structural evidence for functional reorganization, which may be related to connectivity loss in the cingulum.

Abstract: We investigate the use of kernel principal component analysis (PCA) and the inverse problem known as pre-image estimation in neuroimaging: i) We explore kernel PCA and pre-image estimation as a means for image denoising as part of the image preprocessing pipeline. Evaluation of the denoising procedure is performed within a data-driven split-half evaluation framework. ii) We introduce manifold navigation for exploration of a nonlinear data manifold, and illustrate how pre-image estimation can be used to generate brain maps in the continuum between experimentally defined brain states/classes. We base these illustrations on two fMRI BOLD data sets - one from a simple finger tapping experiment and the other from an experiment on object recognition in the ventral temporal lobe.

Abstract: Using MRI-guided off-line TMS, we targeted two areas implicated in biological motion processing: ventral premotor cortex (PMC) and posterior STS (pSTS), plus a control site (vertex). Participants performed a detection task on noise-masked point-light displays of human animations and scrambled versions of the same stimuli. Perceptual thresholds were determined individually. Performance was measured before and after 20 sec of continuous theta burst stimulation of PMC, pSTS, and control (each tested on different days). A matched nonbiological object motion task (detecting point-light displays of translating polygons) served as a further control. Data were analyzed within the signal detection framework. Sensitivity (d') significantly decreased after TMS of PMC. There was a marginally significant decline in d' after TMS of pSTS but not of control site. Criterion (response bias) was also significantly affected by TMS over PMC. Specifically, subjects made significantly more false alarms post-TMS of PMC. These effects were specific to biological motion and not found for the nonbiological control task. To summarize, we report that TMS over PMC reduces sensitivity to biological motion perception. Furthermore, pSTS and PMC may have distinct roles in biological motion processing as behavioral performance differs following TMS in each area. Only TMS over PMC led to a significant increase in false alarms, which was not found for other brain areas or for the control task. TMS of PMC may have interfered with refining judgments about biological motion perception, possibly because access to the perceiver's own motor representations was compromised.

Abstract: This study examined the feasibility of decoding semantic information from human cortical activity. Four human subjects undergoing presurgical brain mapping and seizure foci localization participated in this study. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded while the subjects performed simple language tasks involving semantic information processing, such as a picture naming task where subjects named pictures of objects belonging to different semantic categories. Robust high-gamma band (60-120 Hz) activation was observed at the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) with a temporal sequence corresponding to speech production and perception. Furthermore, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers, two commonly used machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, were able to predict the semantic category of an object using cortical activity captured by ECoG electrodes covering the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. These findings have implications for both basic neuroscience research and development of semantic-based brain-computer interface systems (BCI) that can help individuals with severe motor or communication disorders to express their intention and thoughts.

Abstract: Experience-dependent plasticity in deaf participants has been shown in a variety of studies focused on either the dorsal or ventral aspects of the visual system, but both systems have never been investigated in concert. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated functional plasticity for spatial processing (a dorsal visual pathway function) and for object processing (a ventral visual pathway function) concurrently, in the context of differing sensory (auditory deprivation) and language (use of a signed language) experience. During scanning, deaf native users of American Sign Language (ASL), hearing native ASL users, and hearing participants without ASL experience attended to either the spatial arrangement of frames containing objects or the identity of the objects themselves. These two tasks revealed the expected dorsal/ventral dichotomy for spatial versus object processing in all groups. In addition, the object identity matching task contained both face and house stimuli, allowing us to examine category-selectivity in the ventral pathway in all three participant groups. When contrasting the groups we found that deaf signers differed from the two hearing groups in dorsal pathway parietal regions involved in spatial cognition, suggesting sensory experience-driven plasticity. Group differences in the object processing system indicated that responses in the face-selective right lateral fusiform gyrus and anterior superior temporal cortex were sensitive to a combination of altered sensory and language experience, whereas responses in the amygdala were more closely tied to sensory experience. By selectively engaging the dorsal and ventral visual pathways within participants in groups with different sensory and language experiences, we have demonstrated that these experiences affect the function of both of these systems, and that certain changes are more closely tied to sensory experience, while others are driven by the combination of sensory and language experience.

Abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures from medical images is a challenging problem, which depends on the accurate recognition (localization) of anatomical structures prior to delineation. This study generalizes anatomy segmentation problem via attacking two major challenges: 1) automatically locating anatomical structures without doing search or optimization, and 2) automatically delineating the anatomical structures based on the located model assembly. For 1), we propose intensity weighted ball-scale object extraction concept to build a hierarchical transfer function from image space to object (shape) space such that anatomical structures in 3-D medical images can be recognized without the need to perform search or optimization. For 2), we integrate the graph-cut (GC) segmentation algorithm with prior shape model. This integrated segmentation framework is evaluated on clinical 3-D images consisting of a set of 20 abdominal CT scans. In addition, we use a set of 11 foot MR images to test the generalizability of our method to the different imaging modalities as well as robustness and accuracy of the proposed methodology. Since MR image intensities do not possess a tissue specific numeric meaning, we also explore the effects of intensity nonstandardness on anatomical object recognition. Experimental results indicate that: 1) effective recognition can make the delineation more accurate; 2) incorporating a large number of anatomical structures via a model assembly in the shape model improves the recognition and delineation accuracy dramatically; 3) ball-scale yields useful information about the relationship between the objects and the image; 4) intensity variation among scenes in an ensemble degrades object recognition performance.

Abstract: Grouping processes enable the coherent perception of our environment. A number of brain areas has been suggested to be involved in the integration of elements into objects including early and higher visual areas along the ventral visual pathway as well as motion-processing areas of the dorsal visual pathway. However, integration not only is required for the cortical representation of individual objects, but is also essential for the perception of more complex visual scenes consisting of several different objects and/or shapes. The present fMRI experiments aimed to address such integration processes. We investigated the neural correlates underlying the global Gestalt perception of hierarchically organized stimuli that allowed parametrical degrading of the object at the global level. The comparison of intact versus disturbed perception of the global Gestalt revealed a network of cortical areas including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), anterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus. The TPJ location corresponds well with the areas known to be typically lesioned in stroke patients with simultanagnosia following bilateral brain damage. These patients typically show a deficit in identifying the global Gestalt of a visual scene. Further, we found the closest relation between behavioral performance and fMRI activation for the TPJ. Our data thus argue for a significant role of the TPJ in human global Gestalt perception.

Abstract: The crux of vision is to identify objects and determine their locations in the environment. Although initial visual representations are necessarily retinotopic (eye centered), interaction with the real world requires spatiotopic (absolute) location information. We asked whether higher level human visual cortex-important for stable object recognition and action-contains information about retinotopic and/or spatiotopic object position. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging multivariate pattern analysis techniques, we found information about both object category and object location in each of the ventral, dorsal, and early visual regions tested, replicating previous reports. By manipulating fixation position and stimulus position, we then tested whether these location representations were retinotopic or spatiotopic. Crucially, all location information was purely retinotopic. This pattern persisted when location information was irrelevant to the task, and even when spatiotopic (not retinotopic) stimulus position was explicitly emphasized. We also conducted a "searchlight" analysis across our entire scanned volume to explore additional cortex but again found predominantly retinotopic representations. The lack of explicit spatiotopic representations suggests that spatiotopic object position may instead be computed indirectly and continually reconstructed with each eye movement. Thus, despite our subjective impression that visual information is spatiotopic, even in higher level visual cortex, object location continues to be represented in retinotopic coordinates.

Abstract: We investigated the neural substrates involved in visuo-haptic neuronal convergence using an additive-factors design in combination with fMRI. Stimuli were explored under three sensory modality conditions: viewing the object through a mirror without touching (V), touching the object with eyes closed (H), or simultaneously viewing and touching the object (VH). This modality factor was crossed with a task difficulty factor, which had two levels. On the basis of an idea similar to the principle of inverse effectiveness, we predicted that increasing difficulty would increase the relative level of multisensory gain in brain regions where visual and haptic sensory inputs converged. An ROI analysis focused on the lateral occipital tactile-visual area found evidence of inverse effectiveness in the left lateral occipital tactile-visual area, but not in the right. A whole-brain analysis also found evidence for the same pattern in the anterior aspect of the intraparietal sulcus, the premotor cortex, and the posterior insula, all in the left hemisphere. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate visuo-haptic neuronal convergence based on an inversely effective pattern of brain activation.

Abstract: In the present study, we used the two-pronged trident task to investigate the neural basis of impossible figures processing by using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our fMRI results showed that there were no brain regions with significantly stronger responses to possible condition than to impossible condition. However, impossible condition showed significantly more activation in the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), the fusiform gyrus (FG) and the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG). The right SPG in the dorsal visual pathway might be related to spatial information processing and the right lateral occipital complex (LOC) (FG and ITG) in the ventral visual pathway (the object-selective regions) might be related to the representation of the impossible 3D structure. Therefore, our results indicated that the impossible 3D structure might be difficult to be represented by human visual system, and the impossible perception might be derived from the detecting and resolving the contradiction in the subjects' interpretations according to different perceptions triggered by 3D cues.

Abstract: AIM: In this study, we explored the integrity of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) by means of diffusion tensor imaging tractography in children with visual perceptual impairment, and more specifically, object recognition deficits, compared with typically developing children. METHODS: Eleven individuals (nine males, two females; mean age 7 y 8 mo; range 3 y 5 mo-13 y) were assessed with the L94 visual perceptual battery after assessment of performance age. In all participants, an ophthalmological evaluation was carried out. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography of the ILF was performed. The mean fractional anisotropy was determined for every child and compared with data for 11 age- and sex-matched typically developing children. RESULTS: The mean fractional anisotropy value in the left ILF was consistently lower in the study participants than in the comparison group. The five children with L94 impairment showed a significantly lower ILF fractional anisotropy on the left as well as on the right side. Furthermore, the decrease in ILF fractional anisotropy was correlated with the number of impaired subtests. INTERPRETATION: The results suggest an association between ILF integrity loss and object recognition deficits. Moreover, the severity of clinical impairment is reflected in the degree of ILF integrity loss. Therefore, the ILF plays a potential role in object recognition.

Abstract: We present an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) CMOS chip that implements a synchronized oscillator cellular neural network with a matrix size of 32 x 32 for object sensing and labeling in binary images. Networks of synchronized oscillators are a recently developed tool for image segmentation and analysis. Its parallel network operation is based on a "temporary correlation" theory that attempts to describe scene recognition as if performed by the human brain. The synchronized oscillations of neuron groups attract a person's attention if he or she is focused on a coherent stimulus (image object). For more than one perceived stimulus, these synchronized patterns switch in time between different neuron groups, thus forming temporal maps that code several features of the analyzed scene. In this paper, a new oscillator circuit based on a mathematical model is proposed, and the network architecture and chip functional blocks are presented and discussed. The proposed chip is implemented in AMIS 0.35 mum C035M-D 5M/1P technology. An application of the proposed network chip for the segmentation of insulin-producing pancreatic islets in magnetic resonance liver images is presented.

Abstract: We describe a patient who presented with temporal lobe epilepsy and a seizure onset pattern in the right temporo-occipital area. Structural MRI revealed sclerosis in the right hippocampus. A comprehensive presurgical neuropsychological assessment allowed us to disentangle deficits in visual object recognition and visual imagery from well-preserved spatial capacities. Following a right temporal lobectomy, the patient remained seizure free, and 1 year postsurgery, the patient's scores on object recognition and imagery were in the normal range. Our findings suggest that visual object recognition and visual imagery are sustained by cortical areas located in proximity to the temporo-occipital ventral pathway and that perceptual and imagery spatial processing is subserved as well by anatomically close mechanisms. Furthermore, the results seem to indicate that nonlesional paroxysmal activity in the posterior temporal lobe can cause chronic dysfunctions of the visual system and that it may be reversible with effective seizure control.

Abstract: Dissociations of memory systems are typically made using independent cognitive tests. For example, in monkeys habits have been inferred from performance in object discrimination tests, while non-matching-to-sample tests are thought to measure familiarity resulting from single exposures. Such tests cannot measure individual memory processes accurately when more than one memory process contributes to performance. In process dissociation procedures (PDPs), two memory processes cooperate and compete in the performance of a single cognitive task, allowing quantitative estimates of the contributions of each process. We used PDP to measure the contributions of habits and one-trial memory to visual matching-to-sample performance. Sets of test images were shown only once in each daily testing session but were repeated day after day. To produce habits, high-frequency images were correct more frequently than other images across days. Habits were manifest in the extent to which choices in the test phase of matching-to-sample trials were made to the high-frequency images, regardless of which image had been presented as the sample. One-trial memory was measured by the extent to which choices at test were made to the image that had appeared as the sample on that trial, regardless of habit. Perirhinal cortex removal reduced the contribution of one-trial memory to matching performance, but left both habits and the ability to discriminate images intact. PDP can be applied in monkeys in a way that parallels its use in humans, providing a new tool for investigating the neurobiology of memory in nonhuman animals and for comparing memory across species.

Abstract: Recent research on aging has established important links between the neurobiology of normal aging and age-related decline in episodic memory, yet the exact nature of this relationship is still unknown. Functional neuroimaging of regions such as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) have produced conflicting findings. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have recently shown that young healthy individuals show a stronger activation of the MTL during encoding of objects as compared with encoding of positions. Using the same encoding task, the present study addressed the question whether this greater MTL activation during encoding of objects varies with age. Fifty-four healthy individuals aged between 18 and 81 years underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and subsequently made new-old judgments on objects and positions. Region of interest (ROI) analysis of task related changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was performed in native space after correction for gender effects and individual differences in cerebral blood flow. The hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal, perirhinal, entorhinal, and temporopolar cortices of right and left hemisphere were defined as ROIs. Aging had an adverse effect on memory performance that was similar for memorizing objects or positions. In left and right MTL, relatively greater activation for object stimuli was attenuated in older individuals. Age-related attenuation in content specificity was most prominent in the recognition stage. During recognition, the larger response to objects gradually decreased with age in all ROIs apart from left temporopolar and entorhinal cortex. An age-related attenuation was also present during encoding, but only in right parahippocampus and amygdala. Our results suggest that memory-related processing in the MTL becomes gradually less sensitive to content during normal aging.

Abstract: Inferotemporal cortex (IT) is believed to be directly involved in object processing and necessary for accurate and efficient object recognition. The frontal eye field (FEF) is an area in the primate prefrontal cortex that is involved in visual spatial selection and is thought to guide spatial attention and eye movements. We show that object-selective responses of IT neurons and behavioral performance are affected by changes in frontal eye field activity. This was found in monkeys performing a search classification task by temporarily inactivating subregions of FEF while simultaneously recording the activity from single neurons in IT. The effect on object selectivity and performance was specific, occurring in a predictable spatially dependent manner and was strongest when the IT neuron's preferred target was presented in the presence of distractors. FEF inactivation did not affect IT responses on trials in which the nonpreferred target was presented in the search array.

Abstract: Object-directed action consists of aspects that range from low-level kinematic patterns to high-level action goals. Although previous studies have suggested that the human mirror neuron system (MNS) is involved in understanding or imitating an observed action, it is unclear precisely which levels of action representation are reflected in MNS activity. In this study, we used an imitation-matching task, which is previously used in behavioral experiments for infants, and fMRI to reveal the neural basis for imitation of multiple representations of observed actions. In our experiment, two video footages showing a pen being grasped and placed into one of two cups were sequentially presented. The participants judged whether an actor's action in the first movie was correctly imitated by an imitator in the second movie, regarding the following four aspects: action goal, a means of manipulation, an effector used, and movement trajectory. Although identical sets of stimuli were presented, different brain regions were activated, depending on the matching judgments made by subjects between the two actions. The current study indicates that distinct brain regions are involved in recognition of multiple aspects of transitive actions, which is largely consistent with a visuomotor circuit of action production by the observer.

Abstract: Neural selectivity to specific object categories has been demonstrated in extrastriate cortex with both functional MRI [1-3] and event-related potential (ERP) [4, 5]. Here we tested for a causal relationship between the activation of category-selective areas and ERP to their preferred categories. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants observed faces and headless bodies. Concurrently with EEG recording, we delivered two pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right occipital face area (OFA) or extrastriate body area (EBA) at 60 and 100 ms after stimulus onset. Results showed a clear dissociation between the stimulated site and the stimulus category on ERP modulation: stimulation of the OFA significantly increased the N1 amplitude to faces but not to bodies, whereas stimulation of the EBA significantly increased the N1 amplitude to bodies but not to faces. These findings provide the first evidence for a specific and causal link between activity in category-selective networks and scalp-recorded ERP to their preferred categories. This result also demonstrates that the face and body N1 reflects several nonoverlapping neural sources, rather than changes in face-selective mechanisms alone. Lastly, because early stimulation (60-100 ms) affected selectivity of a later ERP component (150-200 ms), the results could imply a feed-forward connection between occipital and temporal category-selective areas.

Abstract: Viewed object-oriented actions elicit widespread fMRI activation in the dorsal and ventral visual pathways. This activation is typically stronger in the hemisphere contralateral to the visual field in which action is seen. However, since in previous studies participants kept fixation at the same screen position throughout the scan, it was impossible to infer if the viewed actions are represented in retina-based coordinates or in a more elaborated coordinate system. Here, participants changed their gaze between experimental conditions, such that some conditions shared the same retinotopic coordinates (but differed in their screen position), while other pairs of conditions shared the opposite trait. The degree of similarity between the patterns of activation elicited by the various conditions was assessed using multivoxel pattern analysis methods. Regions of interest, showing robust overall activation, included the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the occipitotemporal cortex. In these areas, the correlation between activation patterns for conditions sharing the same retinotopic coordinates was significantly higher than that of those having different retinotopic coordinates. In contrast, the correlations between activation patterns for conditions with the same spatiotopic coordinates were not significantly greater than for non-spatiotopic conditions. These results suggest that viewed object-oriented actions are likely to be maintained in retinotopic-framed coordinates.

Abstract: Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are one of the main causes for casualties among civilians and military personnel in the present war against terror. Mild traumatic brain injury from IEDs induces various degrees of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disturbances but knowledge of the exact brain pathophysiology following exposure to blast is poorly understood. The study was aimed at establishing a murine model for a mild BI-TBI that isolates low-level blast pressure effects to the brain without systemic injuries. An open-field explosives detonation was used to replicate, as closely as possible, low-level blast trauma in the battlefield or at a terror-attack site. No alterations in basic neurological assessment or brain gross pathology were found acutely in the blast-exposed mice. At 7 days post blast, cognitive and behavioral tests revealed significantly decreased performance at both 4 and 7 m distance from the blast (5.5 and 2.5 PSI, respectively). At 30 days post-blast, clear differences were found in animals at both distances in the object recognition test, and in the 7 m group in the Y maze test. Using MRI, T1 weighted images showed an increased BBB permeability 1 month post-blast. DTI analysis showed an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in radial diffusivity. These changes correlated with sites of up-regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase 2 in neurons and CXC-motif chemokine receptor 3 around blood vessels in fiber tracts. These results may represent brain axonal and myelin abnormalities. Cellular and biochemical studies are underway in order to further correlate the blast-induced cognitive and behavioral changes and to identify possible underlying mechanisms that may help develop treatment- and neuroprotective modalities.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This paper studies the feasibility of developing an automatic anatomy segmentation (AAS) system in clinical radiology and demonstrates its operation on clinical 3D images. METHODS: The AAS system, the authors are developing consists of two main parts: object recognition and object delineation. As for recognition, a hierarchical 3D scale-based multiobject method is used for the multiobject recognition task, which incorporates intensity weighted ball-scale (b-scale) information into the active shape model (ASM). For object delineation, an iterative graph-cut-ASM (IGCASM) algorithm is proposed, which effectively combines the rich statistical shape information embodied in ASM with the globally optimal delineation capability of the GC method. The presented IGCASM algorithm is a 3D generalization of the 2D GC-ASM method that they proposed previously in Chen et al. [Proc. SPIE, 7259, 72590C1-72590C-8 (2009)]. The proposed methods are tested on two datasets comprised of images obtained from 20 patients (10 male and 10 female) of clinical abdominal CT scans, and 11 foot magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The test is for four organs (liver, left and right kidneys, and spleen) segmentation, five foot bones (calcaneus, tibia, cuboid, talus, and navicular). The recognition and delineation accuracies were evaluated separately. The recognition accuracy was evaluated in terms of translation, rotation, and scale (size) error. The delineation accuracy was evaluated in terms of true and false positive volume fractions (TPVF, FPVF). The efficiency of the delineation method was also evaluated on an Intel Pentium IV PC with a 3.4 GHZ CPU machine. RESULTS: The recognition accuracies in terms of translation, rotation, and scale error over all organs are about 8 mm, 10 degrees and 0.03, and over all foot bones are about 3.5709 mm, 0.35 degrees and 0.025, respectively. The accuracy of delineation over all organs for all subjects as expressed in TPVF and FPVF is 93.01% and 0.22%, and all foot bones for all subjects are 93.75% and 0.28%, respectively. While the delineations for the four organs can be accomplished quite rapidly with average of 78 s, the delineations for the five foot bones can be accomplished with average of 70 s. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results showed the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed automatic anatomy segmentation system: (a) the incorporation of shape priors into the GC framework is feasible in 3D as demonstrated previously for 2D images; (b) our results in 3D confirm the accuracy behavior observed in 2D. The hybrid strategy IGCASM seems to be more robust and accurate than ASM and GC individually; and (c) delineations within body regions and foot bones of clinical importance can be accomplished quite rapidly within 1.5 min.

Abstract: The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation during a semantic-classification/object-recognition task in 13 persons with Down syndrome and 12 typically developing control participants (age range = 12-26 years). A comparison between groups suggested atypical patterns of brain activation for the individuals with Down syndrome. Correlation analyses between an index of visual spatial ability and brain activation depicted a positive relationship between (a) this index and brain activation in regions of the occipital and parietal lobes for the typically developing individuals and (b) the middle and dorsal frontal gyri in the individuals with Down syndrome. These findings supported the authors' hypothesis that persons with Down syndrome demonstrate atypical neural activation compared with typically developing individuals matched for chronological age.

Abstract: Stimulus inversion impairs face discrimination to a greater extent than discrimination of other non-face object categories. This finding has led to suggestions that upright faces are represented by mechanisms specialized for upright faces whereas inverted face representation depends on more general object recognition mechanisms. In the present study we tested the causal role of face-selective and object-selective cortical areas for upright and inverted face discrimination by transiently disrupting neural processing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Participants matched upright and inverted faces while TMS was delivered over each participant's functionally localized right occipital face area (rOFA) or right lateral occipital area (rLO). TMS delivered over rOFA disrupted the discrimination of upright and inverted faces while TMS delivered over rLO impaired inverted face discrimination only. These results provide causal evidence that upright faces are represented by face-specific mechanisms whereas inverted faces are represented by both face-specific and object-specific mechanisms. The similar sensitivity of the OFA to upright and inverted faces is consistent with the hypothesis that the OFA processes facial features at an early stage of face processing.

Abstract: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate the existence of a mechanism in the human lateral occipital (LO) cortex that supports recognition of real-world visual scenes through parallel analysis of within-scene objects. Neural activity was recorded while subjects viewed four categories of scenes and eight categories of 'signature' objects strongly associated with the scenes in three experiments. Multivoxel patterns evoked by scenes in the LO cortex were well predicted by the average of the patterns elicited by their signature objects. By contrast, there was no relationship between scene and object patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), even though this region responds strongly to scenes and is believed to be crucial for scene identification. By combining information about multiple objects within a scene, the LO cortex may support an object-based channel for scene recognition that complements the processing of global scene properties in the PPA.

Abstract: Contextual cueing refers to the facilitated ability to locate a particular visual element in a scene due to prior exposure to the same scene. This facilitation is thought to reflect implicit learning, as it typically occurs without the observer's knowledge that scenes repeat. Unlike most other implicit learning effects, contextual cueing can be impaired following damage to the medial temporal lobe. Here we investigated neural correlates of contextual cueing and explicit scene memory in two participant groups. Only one group was explicitly instructed about scene repetition. Participants viewed a sequence of complex scenes that depicted a landscape with five abstract geometric objects. Superimposed on each object was a letter T or L rotated left or right by 90 degrees . Participants responded according to the target letter (T) orientation. Responses were highly accurate for all scenes. Response speeds were faster for repeated versus novel scenes. The magnitude of this contextual cueing did not differ between the two groups. Also, in both groups repeated scenes yielded reduced hemodynamic activation compared with novel scenes in several regions involved in visual perception and attention, and reductions in some of these areas were correlated with response-time facilitation. In the group given instructions about scene repetition, recognition memory for scenes was superior and was accompanied by medial temporal and more anterior activation. Thus, strategic factors can promote explicit memorization of visual scene information, which appears to engage additional neural processing beyond what is required for implicit learning of object configurations and target locations in a scene.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The capacity of visual working memory (WM) is substantially limited and only a fraction of what we see is maintained as a temporary trace. The process of binding visual features has been proposed as an adaptive means of minimising information demands on WM. However the neural mechanisms underlying this process, and its modulation by task and load effects, are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neural correlates of feature binding and its modulation by WM load during the sequential phases of encoding, maintenance and retrieval. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 18 young healthy participants performed a visuospatial WM task with independent factors of load and feature conjunction (object identity and position) in an event-related functional MRI study. During stimulus encoding, load-invariant conjunction-related activity was observed in left prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus. During maintenance, greater activity for task demands of feature conjunction versus single features, and for increased load was observed in left-sided regions of the superior occipital cortex, precuneus and superior frontal cortex. Where these effects were expressed in overlapping cortical regions, their combined effect was additive. During retrieval, however, an interaction of load and feature conjunction was observed. This modulation of feature conjunction activity under increased load was expressed through greater deactivation in medial structures identified as part of the default mode network. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The relationship between memory load and feature binding qualitatively differed through each phase of the WM task. Of particular interest was the interaction of these factors observed within regions of the default mode network during retrieval which we interpret as suggesting that at low loads, binding processes may be 'automatic' but at higher loads it becomes a resource-intensive process leading to disengagement of activity in this network. These findings provide new insights into how feature binding operates within the capacity-limited WM system.

Abstract: Functional MRI studies have uncovered a number of brain areas that demonstrate highly specific functional patterns. In the case of visual object recognition, small, focal regions have been characterized with selectivity for visual categories such as human faces. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that automatically learns patterns of functional specificity from fMRI data in a group of subjects. The method does not require spatial alignment of functional images from different subjects. The algorithm is based on a generative model that comprises two main layers. At the lower level, we express the functional brain response to each stimulus as a binary activation variable. At the next level, we define a prior over sets of activation variables in all subjects. We use a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process as the prior in order to learn the patterns of functional specificity shared across the group, which we call functional systems, and estimate the number of these systems. Inference based on our model enables automatic discovery and characterization of dominant and consistent functional systems. We apply the method to data from a visual fMRI study comprised of 69 distinct stimulus images. The discovered system activation profiles correspond to selectivity for a number of image categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes. Among systems found by our method, we identify new areas that are deactivated by face stimuli. In empirical comparisons with previously proposed exploratory methods, our results appear superior in capturing the structure in the space of visual categories of stimuli.

Abstract: It is well established that the formation of memories for life's experiences-episodic memory-is influenced by how we attend to those experiences, yet the neural mechanisms by which attention shapes episodic encoding are still unclear. We investigated how top-down and bottom-up attention contribute to memory encoding of visual objects in humans by manipulating both types of attention during fMRI of episodic memory formation. We show that dorsal parietal cortex-specifically, intraparietal sulcus (IPS)-was engaged during top-down attention and was also recruited during the successful formation of episodic memories. By contrast, bottom-up attention engaged ventral parietal cortex-specifically, temporoparietal junction (TPJ)-and was also more active during encoding failure. Functional connectivity analyses revealed further dissociations in how top-down and bottom-up attention influenced encoding: while both IPS and TPJ influenced activity in perceptual cortices thought to represent the information being encoded (fusiform/lateral occipital cortex), they each exerted opposite effects on memory encoding. Specifically, during a preparatory period preceding stimulus presentation, a stronger drive from IPS was associated with a higher likelihood that the subsequently attended stimulus would be encoded. By contrast, during stimulus processing, stronger connectivity with TPJ was associated with a lower likelihood the stimulus would be successfully encoded. These findings suggest that during encoding of visual objects into episodic memory, top-down and bottom-up attention can have opposite influences on perceptual areas that subserve visual object representation, suggesting that one manner in which attention modulates memory is by altering the perceptual processing of to-be-encoded stimuli.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a 3-D spinal deformity with uncertain etiology; abnormalities in brain development represent one of the possible explanatory concepts for its pathogenesis. The objective of this study is to investigate the brain maturation by thickness of cerebral cortex among female adolescents with and without idiopathic scoliosis. Fifty AIS patients with a typical right-thoracic curve pattern were compared with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Based on the T1-weighted magnetic resonance images, the thickness of cortical gray-matter was calculated using a well-validated surface measurement method. Focusing on adolescent participants within the age range with the frequent occurrences of AIS cases (i.e., 12 to 17 years), we observed that the cortical thickness declined significantly in almost all cortical lobes in normal subjects (Spearman correlation<-0.4; P </= 0.05) except temporal lobe in LH, while in AIS patients this decline was weakly correlated with age (Spearman correlation>-0.4) and largely insignificant (P >/= 0.05). Quadratic regression results expressed the detailed difference in the age-related cortical changing pattern between the two groups. In addition, focal cortical thickness was significantly different in AIS patients compared with healthy controls in areas involved in motor and vestibular functions as well as object recognition. The findings from this study imply a different thinning pattern of the cerebral cortex during adolescence in patients with AIS; this may be primary (i.e. etiopathogenetic) or secondary (i.e. adaptation) to the development of scoliosis.

Abstract: Recent neuroimaging evidence indicates that visual consciousness of objects is reflected by the activation in the lateral occipital cortex as well as in the frontal and parietal cortex. However, most previous studies used behavioral paradigms in which attention raised or enhanced visual consciousness (visibility or recognition performance). This co-occurrence made it difficult to reveal whether an observed cortical activation is related to visual consciousness or attention. The present fMRI study investigated the dissociability of neural activations underlying these two cognitive phenomena. Toward this aim, we used a visual backward masking paradigm in which directing attention could either enhance or reduce the object visibility. The participants' task was to report the level of subjective visibility for a briefly presented target object. The target was presented in the center with four flankers, which was followed by the same number of masks. Behavioral results showed that attention to the flankers enhanced the target visibility, whereas attention to the masks attenuated it. The fMRI results showed that the occipito-temporal sulcus increased activation in the attend flankers condition compared with the attend masks condition, and occipito-temporal sulcus activation levels positively correlated with the target visibility in both attentional conditions. On the other hand, the inferior frontal gyrus and the intraparietal sulcus increased activation in both the attend flankers and attend masks compared with an attend neither condition, and these activation levels were independent of target visibility. Taken together, present results showed a clear dissociation in neural activities between conscious visibility and attention.

Abstract: Human neuroplasticity of multisensory integration has been studied mainly in the context of natural or artificial training situations in healthy subjects. However, regular smokers also offer the opportunity to assess the impact of intensive daily multisensory interactions with smoking-related objects on the neural correlates of crossmodal object processing. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study revealed that smokers show a comparable visuo-haptic integration pattern for both smoking paraphernalia and control objects in the left lateral occipital complex, a region playing a crucial role in crossmodal object recognition. Moreover, the degree of nicotine dependence correlated positively with the magnitude of visuo-haptic integration in the left lateral occipital complex (LOC) for smoking-associated but not for control objects. In contrast, in the left LOC non-smokers displayed a visuo-haptic integration pattern for control objects, but not for smoking paraphernalia. This suggests that prolonged smoking-related multisensory experiences in smokers facilitate the merging of visual and haptic inputs in the lateral occipital complex for the respective stimuli. Studying clinical populations who engage in compulsive activities may represent an ecologically valid approach to investigating the neuroplasticity of multisensory integration.

Abstract: Object recognition occurs even when environmental information is incomplete. Illusory contours (ICs), in which a contour is perceived though the contour edges are incomplete, have been extensively studied as an example of such a visual completion phenomenon. Despite the neural activity in response to ICs in visual cortical areas from low (V1 and V2) to high (LOC: the lateral occipital cortex) levels, the details of the neural processing underlying IC perception are largely not clarified. For example, how do the visual areas function in IC perception and how do they interact to archive the coherent contour perception? IC perception involves the process of completing the local discrete contour edges (contour completion) and the process of representing the global completed contour information (contour representation). Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to dissociate contour completion and contour representation by varying each in opposite directions. The results show that the neural activity was stronger to stimuli with more contour completion than to stimuli with more contour representation in V1 and V2, which was the reverse of that in the LOC. When inspecting the neural activity change across the visual pathway, the activation remained high for the stimuli with more contour completion and increased for the stimuli with more contour representation. These results suggest distinct neural correlates of contour completion and contour representation, and the possible collaboration between the two processes during IC perception, indicating a neural connection between the discrete retinal input and the coherent visual percept.

Abstract: Electrophysiological and behavioral studies in many species have demonstrated mirror-image confusion for objects, perhaps because many objects are vertically symmetric (e.g., a cup is the same cup when seen in left or right profile). In contrast, the navigability of a scene changes when it is mirror reversed, and behavioral studies reveal high sensitivity to this change. Thus, we predicted that representations in object-selective cortex will be unaffected by mirror reversals, whereas representations in scene-selective cortex will be sensitive to such reversals. To test this hypothesis, we ran an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation experiment in human adults. Consistent with our prediction, we found tolerance to mirror reversals in one object-selective region, the posterior fusiform sulcus, and a strong sensitivity to these reversals in two scene-selective regions, the transverse occipital sulcus and the retrosplenial complex. However, a more posterior object-selective region, the lateral occipital sulcus, showed sensitivity to mirror reversals, suggesting that the sense information that distinguishes mirror images is represented at earlier stages in the object-processing hierarchy. Moreover, one scene-selective region (the parahippocampal place area or PPA) was tolerant to mirror reversals. This last finding challenges the hypothesis that the PPA is involved in navigation and reorientation and suggests instead that scenes, like objects, are processed by distinct pathways guiding recognition and action.

Abstract: Human beings are social organisms with an intrinsic desire to seek and participate in social interactions. Social anhedonia is a personality trait characterized by a reduced desire for social affiliation and reduced pleasure derived from interpersonal interactions. Abnormally high levels of social anhedonia prospectively predict the development of schizophrenia and contribute to poorer outcomes for schizophrenia patients. Despite the strong association between social anhedonia and schizophrenia, the neural mechanisms that underlie individual differences in social anhedonia have not been studied and are thus poorly understood. Deficits in face emotion recognition are related to poorer social outcomes in schizophrenia, and it has been suggested that face emotion recognition deficits may be a behavioral marker for schizophrenia liability. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to see whether there are differences in the brain networks underlying basic face emotion processing in a community sample of individuals low vs. high in social anhedonia. We isolated the neural mechanisms related to face emotion processing by comparing face emotion discrimination with four other baseline conditions (identity discrimination of emotional faces, identity discrimination of neutral faces, object discrimination, and pattern discrimination). Results showed a group (high/low social anhedonia) x condition (emotion discrimination/control condition) interaction in the anterior portion of the rostral medial prefrontal cortex, right superior temporal gyrus, and left somatosensory cortex. As predicted, high (relative to low) social anhedonia participants showed less neural activity in face emotion processing regions during emotion discrimination as compared to each control condition. The findings suggest that social anhedonia is associated with abnormalities in networks responsible for basic processes associated with social cognition, and provide a starting point for understanding the neural basis of social motivation and our drive to seek social affiliation.

Abstract: The ideal Bayesian observer is a mathematical construct which makes optimal use of all statistical information about the object and imaging system to perform a task. Its performance serves as an upper bound on any observer's task performance. In this paper a methodology based on the ideal observer for assessing magnetic resonance (MR) acquisition sequences and reconstruction algorithms is developed. The ideal observer in the context of MR imaging is defined and expressions for ideal observer performance metrics are derived. Comparisons are made between the raw-data ideal observer and image-based ideal observer to elucidate the effect of image reconstruction on task performance. Lesion detection tasks are studied in detail via analytical expressions and simulations. The effect of imaging sequence parameters on lesion detectability is shown and the advantages of this methodology over image quality metrics currently in use in MR imaging is demonstrated.

Abstract: This study investigates novel object-interaction priors for graph cut image segmentation with application to intervertebral disc delineation in magnetic resonance (MR) lumbar spine images. The algorithm optimizes an original cost function which constrains the solution with learned prior knowledge about the geometric interactions between different objects in the image. Based on a global measure of similarity between distributions, the proposed priors are intrinsically invariant with respect to translation and rotation. We further introduce a scale variable from which we derive an original fixed-point equation (FPE), thereby achieving scale-invariance with only few fast computations. The proposed priors relax the need of costly pose estimation (or registration) procedures and large training sets (we used a single subject for training), and can tolerate shape deformations, unlike template-based priors. Our formulation leads to an NP-hard problem which does not afford a form directly amenable to graph cut optimization. We proceeded to a relaxation of the problem via an auxiliary function, thereby obtaining a nearly real-time solution with few graph cuts. Quantitative evaluations over 60 intervertebral discs acquired from 10 subjects demonstrated that the proposed algorithm yields a high correlation with independent manual segmentations by an expert. We further demonstrate experimentally the invariance of the proposed geometric attributes. This supports the fact that a single subject is sufficient for training our algorithm, and confirms the relevance of the proposed priors to disc segmentation.

Abstract: It is commonly accepted that the hippocampus plays a major role in declarative memory across species and that it is of particular relevance for spatial memory in rodents. However, the interplay between hippocampal function and nondeclarative memory systems, such as procedural stimulus-response (S-R) or sequential learning, is less clear: depending on task requirements, an interaction, dissociation or interference between hippocampal function and other memory systems may occur. This study was conducted to investigate the influence of dorsal ibotenic hippocampal lesions on learning and performance of sequential behavior in a rat version of the serial reaction time task (SRTT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses of the lesions revealed a bilateral volume reduction of approximately 46% (histological analyses: approximately 59%) of the total hippocampus. They were largely confined to its dorsal part and led to an expected spatial memory deficits in an object place recognition test as compared to healthy controls, even though sham lesions had the same effect. Our earlier studies on sequential learning had revealed substantial impairments in case of dorsal striatal dopaminergic lesions. In the present study, however, hippocampal lesioned animals unexpectedly showed superior performance throughout SRTT testing and training as compared to controls, which resulted in a higher degree of subsequent automated sequential behavior. Thus, our data reveal the infrequent case where hippocampal lesions lead to long-term improvements in test performance of a type of rather complex procedural behavior. One possible explanation for this effect is that hippocampal activity in rodents can interfere with other memory systems during the acquisition of procedural tasks with very low spatial requirements, as used here. Alternative explanations for the observed superior SRTT performance in lesioned animals, such as hyperactivity or increased exploratory drive are also topic of the discussion.

Abstract: Cortical reorganization of visual and object representations following neural injury was examined using fMRI and behavioral investigations. We probed the visual responsivity of the ventral visual cortex of an agnosic patient who was impaired at object recognition following a lesion to the right lateral fusiform gyrus. In both hemispheres, retinotopic mapping revealed typical topographic organization and visual activation of early visual cortex. However, visual responses, object-related, and -selective responses were reduced in regions immediately surrounding the lesion in the right hemisphere, and also, surprisingly, in corresponding locations in the structurally intact left hemisphere. In contrast, hV4 of the right hemisphere showed expanded response properties. These findings indicate that the right lateral fusiform gyrus is critically involved in object recognition and that an impairment to this region has widespread consequences for remote parts of cortex. Finally, functional neural plasticity is possible even when a cortical lesion is sustained in adulthood.

Abstract: We present a model which stems from a well-established model of object recognition, HMAX, and show how this feedforward system can include feedback, using a recently proposed architecture which reconciles biased competition and predictive coding approaches. Simulation results show successful feedforward object recognition, including cases of occluded and illusory images. Recognition is both position and size invariant. The model also provides a functional interpretation of the role of feedback connectivity in accounting for several observed effects such as enhancement, suppression and refinement of activity in lower areas. The model can qualitatively replicate responses in early visual cortex to occluded and illusory contours; and fMRI data showing that high-level object recognition reduces activity in lower areas. A Gestalt-like mechanism based on collinearity, co-orientation and good continuation principles is proposed to explain illusory contour formation which allows the system to adapt a single high-level object prototype to illusory Kanizsa figures of different sizes, shapes and positions. Overall the model provides a biophysiologically plausible interpretation, supported by current experimental evidence, of the interaction between top-down global feedback and bottom-up local evidence in the context of hierarchical object perception.

Abstract: Mammals are highly skilled in rapidly detecting objects in cluttered natural environments, a skill necessary for survival. What are the neural mechanisms mediating detection of objects in natural scenes? Here, we use human brain imaging to address the role of top-down preparatory processes in the detection of familiar object categories in real-world environments. Brain activity was measured while participants were preparing to detect highly variable depictions of people or cars in natural scenes that were new to the participants. The preparation to detect objects of the target category, in the absence of visual input, evoked activity patterns in visual cortex that resembled the response to actual exemplars of the target category. Importantly, the selectivity of multivoxel preparatory activity patterns in object-selective cortex (OSC) predicted target detection performance. By contrast, preparatory activity in early visual cortex (V1) was negatively related to search performance. Additional behavioral results suggested that the dissociation between OSC and V1 reflected the use of different search strategies, linking OSC preparatory activity to relatively abstract search preparation and V1 to more specific imagery-like preparation. Finally, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed that, in addition to OSC, response patterns in medial prefrontal cortex distinguished the target categories based on the search cues alone, suggesting that this region may constitute a top-down source of preparatory activity observed in visual cortex. These results indicate that in naturalistic situations, when the precise visual characteristics of target objects are not known in advance, preparatory activity at higher levels of the visual hierarchy selectively mediates visual search.

Abstract: How and where in the human brain high-level sensorimotor processes such as intentions and decisions are coded remain important yet essentially unanswered questions. This is in part because, to date, decoding intended actions from brain signals has been primarily constrained to invasive neural recordings in nonhuman primates. Here we demonstrate using functional MRI (fMRI) pattern recognition techniques that we can also decode movement intentions from human brain signals, specifically object-directed grasp and reach movements, moments before their initiation. Subjects performed an event-related delayed movement task toward a single centrally located object (consisting of a small cube attached atop a larger cube). For each trial, after visual presentation of the object, one of three hand movements was instructed: grasp the top cube, grasp the bottom cube, or reach to touch the side of the object (without preshaping the hand). We found that, despite an absence of fMRI signal amplitude differences between the planned movements, the spatial activity patterns in multiple parietal and premotor brain areas accurately predicted upcoming grasp and reach movements. Furthermore, the patterns of activity in a subset of these areas additionally predicted which of the two cubes were to be grasped. These findings offer new insights into the detailed movement information contained in human preparatory brain activity and advance our present understanding of sensorimotor planning processes through a unique description of parieto-frontal regions according to the specific types of hand movements they can predict.

Abstract: The role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in associative memory encoding has been the focus of many memory experiments. However, there has been surprisingly little investigation of whether the contributions of different MTL subregions (amygdala, hippocampus [HPC], parahippocampal [PHc], perirhinal cortex [PRc], and temporal polar cortex [TPc]) shift across multiple presentations during associative encoding. We examined this issue using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a multivoxel pattern classification analysis. Subjects performed a visual search task, becoming faster with practice to locate objects whose locations were held constant across trials. The classification analysis implicated right HPC and amygdala early in the task when the speed-up from trial to trial was greatest. The same analysis implicated right PRc and TPc late in learning when speed-up was minimal. These results suggest that associative encoding relies on complex patterns of neural activity in MTL that cannot be expressed by simple increases or decreases of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal during learning. Involvement of MTL subregions during encoding of object-location associations depends on the nature of the learning phase. Right HPC and amygdala support active integration of object and location information, while right PRc and TPc are involved when object and spatial representations become unitized into a single representation.

Abstract: Perceptual organization (PO) refers to the processes by which visual information is structured into coherent patterns such as groups, contours, perceptual wholes, and object representations. Impairments in PO have been demonstrated in schizophrenia since the 1960s and have been linked to several illness-related factors including poor premorbid functioning, poor prognosis, and disorganized symptoms. This literature was last reviewed in 2005. Since then, electrophysiological (electroencephalographic, event-related potential, and magnetoencephalographic) and fMRI studies in both patient and nonpatient samples have clarified brain mechanisms involved in the impairment, and additional behavioral studies in patients and nonpatients have clarified the computational mechanisms. In addition, data now exist on the functional consequences of PO impairments, in terms of secondary difficulties in face processing, selective attention, working memory, and social cognition. Preliminary data on drug effects on PO and on changes in response to treatment suggest that anomalies in PO may furnish a biomarker for the integrity of its associated biological mechanisms. All of this recent evidence allows for a clearer picture of the nature of the impairment and how it relates to broader aspects of brain and behavioral functioning in schizophrenia.

Abstract: How the different elements of our experiences are encoded into episodic memories has remained one of the major questions in memory research. Although the pivotal role of the medial temporal lobe as a whole for memory formation is well established, much controversy surrounds the precise contributions of the subregions in the medial temporal lobe cortex (MTLC), most notably the perirhinal cortex (PrC) and the parahippocampal cortex (PhC). Although one prominent view links PrC processes with familiarity-based memory and PhC with recollection, an alternative organizing principle is the representational domain critical for successful memory performance (e.g., object- versus scene-related information). In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we directly compared successful source encoding during object versus scene imagery, holding perceptual input constant across the two representational domains. Although the hippocampus contributed to associative encoding of both object and scene information, our results revealed a clear double dissociation between PrC and PhC for object- versus scene-related source encoding. In particular, PrC, but not PhC, encoding activation predicted later source memory for the object imagery task, whereas PhC, but not PrC, encoding activation predicted later source memory for the scene imagery task. Interestingly, the transitional zone between PrC and posterior PhC contributed to both object and scene source encoding, possibly reflecting a gradient in domain preference along MTLC. In sum, these results strongly point to representational domain as a key factor determining the involvement of different MTLC subregions during successful episodic memory formation.

Abstract: Objects along a route can help us to successfully navigate through our surroundings. Previous neuroimaging research has shown that the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) distinguishes between objects that were previously encountered at navigationally relevant locations (decision points) and irrelevant locations (nondecision points) during simple object recognition. This study aimed at unraveling how this neural marking of objects relevant for navigation is established during learning and postlearning rest. Twenty-four participants were scanned using fMRI while they were viewing a route through a virtual environment. Eye movements were measured, and brain responses were time-locked to viewing each object. The PHG showed increased responses to decision point objects compared with nondecision point objects during route learning. We compared functional connectivity between the PHG and the rest of the brain in a resting state scan postlearning with such a scan prelearning. Results show that functional connectivity between the PHG and the hippocampus is positively related to participants' self-reported navigational ability. On the other hand, connectivity with the caudate nucleus correlated negatively with navigational ability. These results are in line with a distinction between egocentric and allocentric spatial representations in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus, respectively. Our results thus suggest a relation between navigational ability and a neural preference for a specific type of spatial representation. Together, these results show that the PHG is immediately involved in the encoding of navigationally relevant object information. Furthermore, they provide insight into the neural correlates of individual differences in spatial ability.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the recovery process in patients after an acute optic neuritis (ON) attack, comparing static and dynamic visual functions. METHODS: In this prospective controlled study, 21 patients with unilateral, first-ever ON were followed over the course of 1 year. Standard visual tests, visual evoked potentials, and optical coherence tomography were assessed repeatedly. In addition, we developed a novel set of motion perceptual tasks to test dynamic visual deficits. fMRI examinations were performed to study the neuronal correlates for the behavioral findings. RESULTS: Four months after the acute phase, the affected eyes had returned to normal performance levels in the routine visual testing. However, motion perception remained impaired throughout the 12-month period. In agreement with the clinical findings, fMRI studies showed recovery in cortical activation during static object recognition, as opposed to sustained deficit in tasks that require motion perception. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained motion perception deficit following ON may explain the continued visual complaints of patients long after recovery of visual acuity. Cortical activation patterns suggest that if plastic processes in higher visual regions contribute to the recovery of vision, this may be limited to static visual functions. Alternatively, cortical activation may reflect the visual percept (intact for visual acuity and impaired for motion perception), rather than demonstrating plastic processes. We suggest that motion perception should be included in the routine ophthalmologic tests following ON.

Abstract: Ventral visual cortex contains specialized regions for particular object categories, but little is known about how these regions interact during object recognition. Here we examine how the face-selective fusiform gyrus (FG) and the scene-selective parahippocampal cortex (PHC) interact with each other and with the rest of the brain during different visual tasks. To assess these interactions, we developed a novel approach for identifying patterns of connectivity associated with specific task sets, independent of stimulus-evoked responses. We tested whether this "background connectivity" between the FG and PHC was modulated when subjects engaged in face and scene processing tasks. In contrast to what would be predicted from biased competition or intrinsic activity accounts, we found that the strength of FG-PHC background connectivity depended on which category was task relevant: connectivity increased when subjects attended to scenes (irrespective of whether a competing face was present) and decreased when subjects attended to faces (irrespective of competing scenes). We further discovered that posterior occipital cortex was correlated selectively with the FG during face tasks and the PHC during scene tasks. These results suggest that category specificity exists not only in which regions respond most strongly but also in how these and other regions interact.

Abstract: Traditionally, the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is thought to be dedicated to declarative memory. Recent evidence challenges this view, suggesting that perirhinal cortex (PrC), which interfaces the MTL with the ventral visual pathway, supports highly integrated object representations in recognition memory and perceptual discrimination. Even with comparable representational demands, perceptual and memory tasks differ in numerous task demands and the subjective experience they evoke. Here, we tested whether such differences are reflected in distinct patterns of connectivity between PrC and other cortical regions, including differential involvement of prefrontal control processes. We examined functional magnetic resonance imaging data for closely matched perceptual and recognition memory tasks for faces that engaged right PrC equivalently. Multivariate seed analyses revealed distinct patterns of interactions: Right ventrolateral prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices exhibited stronger functional connectivity with PrC in recognition memory; fusiform regions were part of the pattern that displayed stronger functional connectivity with PrC in perceptual discrimination. Structural equation modeling revealed distinct patterns of effective connectivity that allowed us to constrain interpretation of these findings. Overall, they demonstrate that, even when MTL structures show similar involvement in recognition memory and perceptual discrimination, differential neural mechanisms are reflected in the interplay between the MTL and other cortical regions.

Abstract: A significant proportion of human cortex is involved in visual processing. Cerebral regions beyond striate cortex show specialization for specific stimulus properties: damage to these regions leads to syndromes that also reflect this specialization. These syndromes can be grouped into two broad categories. In the ventral group, there is damage to medial occipitotemporal structures that participate in object identification and recognition. This can result in a variety of syndromes, including achromatopsia, general visual object agnosia, or more selective object recognition deficits such as prosopagnosia, alexia, and certain forms of topographagnosia, such as landmark agnosia. In the second, dorsal group, there is damage to lateral occipitoparietal structures that participate in visuospatial processing and localization. Patients with such damage may have akinetopsia (impaired motion processing), various components of Balint syndrome, or astereopsis. Finally, it is also possible to find patients in whom residual visual processing is evident despite damage to the geniculostriate pathway; this blindsight may reflect residual function of either subcortical structures, such as the superior colliculus, or alternate afferent routes to surviving extrastriate cortex.

Abstract: Reading systematically activates the left lateral occipitotemporal sulcus, at a site known as the visual word form area (VWFA). This site is reproducible across individuals/scripts, attuned to reading-specific processes, and partially selective for written strings relative to other categories such as line drawings. Lesions affecting the VWFA cause pure alexia, a selective deficit in word recognition. These findings must be reconciled with the fact that human genome evolution cannot have been influenced by such a recent and culturally variable activity as reading. Capitalizing on recent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we provide strong corroborating evidence for the hypothesis that reading acquisition partially recycles a cortical territory evolved for object and face recognition, the prior properties of which influenced the form of writing systems.

Abstract: The question of whether the neural encodings of objects are similar across different people is one of the key questions in cognitive neuroscience. This article examines the commonalities in the internal representation of objects, as measured with fMRI, across individuals in two complementary ways. First, we examine the commonalities in the internal representation of objects across people at the level of interobject distances, derived from whole brain fMRI data, and second, at the level of spatially localized anatomical brain regions that contain sufficient information for identification of object categories, without making the assumption that their voxel patterns are spatially matched in a common space. We examine the commonalities in internal representation of objects on 3T fMRI data collected while participants viewed line drawings depicting various tools and dwellings. This exploratory study revealed the extent to which the representation of individual concepts, and their mutual similarity, is shared across participants.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that encoding information in the context of self-evaluation leads to memory enhancement, supported by activation in ventromedial pFC. Recent evidence suggests that similar self-memory advantages can be obtained under nonevaluative encoding conditions, such as when object ownership is used to evoke self-reference. Using fMRI, the current study explored the neural correlates of object ownership. During scanning, participants sorted everyday objects into self-owned or other-owned categories. Replicating previous research, a significant self-memory advantage for the objects was observed (i.e., self-owned > other-owned). In addition, encoding self-owned items was associated with unique activation in posterior dorsomedial pFC (dMPFC), left insula, and bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMG). Subsequent analysis showed that activation in a subset of these regions (dMPFC and left SMG) correlated with the magnitude of the self-memory advantage. Analysis of the time-to-peak data suggested a temporal model for processing ownership in which initial activation of dMPFC spreads to SMG and insula. These results indicate that a self-memory advantage can be elicited by object ownership and that this effect is underpinned by activity in a neural network that supports attentional, reward, and motor processing.

Abstract: The effects of attention and object configuration on the neural responses to short-lag visual image repetition were investigated with fMRI. Attention to one of two object images in a prime display was cued spatially. The images were either intact or split vertically; a manipulation that negates the influence of view-based representations. A subsequent single intact probe image was named covertly. Behavioural priming observed as faster button presses was found for attended primes in both intact and split configurations, but only for uncued primes in the intact configuration. In a voxel-wise analysis, fMRI repetition suppression (RS) was observed in a left mid-fusiform region for attended primes, both intact and split, whilst a right intraparietal region showed repetition enhancement (RE) for intact primes, regardless of attention. In a factorial analysis across regions of interest (ROIs) defined from independent localiser contrasts, RS for attended objects in the ventral stream was significantly left-lateralised, whilst repetition effects in ventral and dorsal ROIs correlated with the amount of priming in specific conditions. These fMRI results extend hybrid theories of object recognition, implicating left ventral stream regions in analytic processing (requiring attention), consistent with prior hypotheses about hemispheric specialisation, and implicating dorsal stream regions in holistic processing (independent of attention).

Abstract: It has recently been shown that a lack of vestibular sensory information decreases spatial memory performance and induces biochemical changes in the hippocampus in rodents. After vestibular neurectomy, patients display spatial memory deficit and hippocampal atrophy. Our objectives were to explore: (a) spatial (Y maze, radial-arm maze), and non-spatial (object recognition) memory performance, (b) modulation of NMDA receptors within the hippocampus using radioligand binding, and (c) hippocampal atrophy, using MRI, in a rat model of bilateral labyrinthectomy realized in two operations. Chemical vestibular lesions (VLs) were induced in 24 animals by transtympanic injections of sodium arsanilate (30 mg/0.1 ml/ear), one side being lesioned 3 weeks after the other. The control group received transtympanic saline solution (0.1 ml/ear) (n = 24). Spatial memory performance (Y maze and radial maze) decreased after VL. Conversely, non-spatial memory performance (object recognition) was not affected by VL. No hippocampal atrophy was observed with MRI, but density of NMDA receptors were increased in the hippocampus after VL. These findings show that the lack of vestibular information induced specific deficits in spatial memory. Additionally, quantitative autoradiographic data suggest the involvement of the glutamatergic system in spatial memory processes related to vestibular information. When studying spatial memory performances in the presence of vestibular syndrome, two-step labyrinthectomy is a suitable procedure for distinguishing between the roles of the specific components of vestibular input loss and those of impaired locomotor activity.

Abstract: Most models of visual object recognition assume that items belonging to known categories are represented in long-term memory in terms of both structural descriptions and semantic representations. The former specify the visual appearance of category members and the latter allow recognising them as meaningful objects. Nevertheless, the format of these two kinds of representations and their relationships are still a matter of debate. Recently, the independence of structural and semantic representations has been questioned on the basis of the finding of an impaired performance of subjects suffering from semantic dementia on the object decision task, which was originally devised to tap the structural description system. In the present case study of a patient with semantic dementia, we provide data supporting the independence of these two systems. Our results allowed us to better qualify the content and format of structural descriptions in terms of purely geometric non-verbalizable information, specifying the appearance of exemplars at a rather coarse level of categorisation.

Abstract: During object perception, the brain integrates simple features into representations of complex objects. A perceptual phenomenon known as visual crowding selectively interferes with this process. Here, we use crowding to characterize a neural correlate of feature integration. Cortical activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, simultaneously in multiple areas of the ventral visual pathway (V1-V4 and the visual word form area, VWFA, which responds preferentially to familiar letters), while human subjects viewed crowded and uncrowded letters. Temporal correlations between cortical areas were lower for crowded letters than for uncrowded letters, especially between V1 and VWFA. These differences in correlation were retinotopically specific, and persisted when attention was diverted from the letters. But correlation differences were not evident when we substituted the letters with grating patches that were not crowded under our stimulus conditions. We conclude that inter-area correlations reflect feature integration and are disrupted by crowding. We propose that crowding may perturb the transformations between neural representations along the ventral pathway that underlie the integration of features into objects.

Abstract: Late ventral visual areas generally consist of cells having a significant degree of translation invariance. Such a "bag of features" representation is useful for the recognition of individual objects; however, it seems unable to explain our ability to parse a scene into multiple objects and to understand their spatial relationships. We review several schemes (e.g., global features and serial attention) for how to reconcile bag-of-features representation with our ability to understand relationships; we review structural description theories that, in contrast, suggest that a neural binding mechanism assigns the features of each object in a scene to a separate "slot" to which relational information for that object is explicitly bound. Four functional magnetic resonance imaging-adaptation experiments assessed how ventral stream regions respond to rearrangements of two objects in a minimal scene that depict scene translations and relational changes. Changes of relative position (e.g., elephant above bus changing to bus above elephant) produced larger releases of adaptation in the anterior lateral occipital complex (LOC) than physically equivalent translations, providing evidence that spatial relations are explicitly encoded in the anterior LOC in agreement with structural description theories.

Abstract: Primate multisensory object perception involves distributed brain regions. To investigate the network character of these regions of the human brain, we applied data-driven group spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set acquired during a passive audio-visual (AV) experiment with common object stimuli. We labeled three group-level independent component (IC) maps as auditory (A), visual (V), and AV, based on their spatial layouts and activation time courses. The overlap between these IC maps served as definition of a distributed network of multisensory candidate regions including superior temporal, ventral occipito-temporal, posterior parietal and prefrontal regions. During an independent second fMRI experiment, we explicitly tested their involvement in AV integration. Activations in nine out of these twelve regions met the max-criterion (A < AV > V) for multisensory integration. Comparison of this approach with a general linear model-based region-of-interest definition revealed its complementary value for multisensory neuroimaging. In conclusion, we estimated functional networks of uni- and multisensory functional connectivity from one dataset and validated their functional roles in an independent dataset. These findings demonstrate the particular value of ICA for multisensory neuroimaging research and using independent datasets to test hypotheses generated from a data-driven analysis.

Abstract: Defining the exact mechanisms by which the brain processes visual objects and scenes remains an unresolved challenge. Valuable clues to this process have emerged from the demonstration that clusters of neurons ("modules") in inferior temporal cortex apparently respond selectively to specific categories of visual stimuli, such as places/scenes. However, the higher-order "category-selective" response could also reflect specific lower-level spatial factors. Here we tested this idea in multiple functional MRI experiments, in humans and macaque monkeys, by systematically manipulating the spatial content of geometrical shapes and natural images. These tests revealed that visual spatial discontinuities (as reflected by an increased response to high spatial frequencies) selectively activate a well-known place-selective region of visual cortex (the "parahippocampal place area") in humans. In macaques, we demonstrate a homologous cortical area, and show that it also responds selectively to higher spatial frequencies. The parahippocampal place area may use such information for detecting object borders and scene details during spatial perception and navigation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In spatial navigation, landmark recognition is crucial. Specifically, memory for objects placed at decision points on a route is relevant. Previous fMRI research in healthy adults showed higher medial-temporal lobe (MTL) activation for objects placed at decision points compared to non-decision points, even at an implicit level. Since there is evidence that implicit learning is intact in amnesic patients, the current study examined memory for objects relevant for navigation in patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 21 AD patients participated with MTL atrophy assessed on MRI (mean MMSE = 21.2, SD = 4.0), as well as 20 age- and education-matched non-demented controls. All participants watched a 5-min video showing a route through a virtual museum with 20 objects placed at intersections (decision points) and 20 at simple turns (non-decision points). The instruction was to pay attention to the toys (half of the objects) for which they were supposedly tested later. Subsequently, a recognition test followed with the 40 previously presented objects among 40 distracter items (both toys and non-toys). Results showed a better performance for the non-toy objects placed at decision points than non-decision points, both for AD patients and controls. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that AD patients with MTL damage have implicit memory for object information relevant for navigation. No decision point effect was found for the attended items. Possibly, focusing attention on the items occurred at the cost of the context information in AD, whereas the controls performed at an optimal level due to intact memory function.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel active contour (AC) model for medical image segmentation that is based on a convex combination of two energy functionals to both minimize the inhomogeneity within an object and maximize the distance between the object and the background. This combination is necessary because objects in medical images, e.g., bones, are usually highly inhomogeneous while distinct organs should generate distinct image configurations. Compared with the conventional Chan-Vese AC, the proposed model yields similar performance in a set of CT images but performs better in an MRI data set, which is generally in lower contrast.

Abstract: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess cortical involvement in a hidden pattern task. The experimental and control conditions involved judgment of the presence/absence versus the position of a complex pattern. Activation specific to hidden pattern identification was concentrated on frontal, dorsal parietal, and mesolimbic cortex. This was consistent not only across individual subjects, but with hidden figures tasks used in previous fMRI investigations. Results suggest that pattern identification relies on a relatively stable neural network controlling selective attention. In combination with fMRI, hidden pattern tasks may be useful in neuropsychological assessment of visual search and object identification.

*Williams Syndrome
Abstract: Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder associated with severe visuospatial deficits, relatively strong language skills, heightened social interest, and increased attention to faces. On the basis of the visuospatial deficits, this disorder has been characterized primarily as a deficit of the dorsal stream, the occipitoparietal brain regions that subserve visuospatial processing. However, some evidence indicates that this disorder may also affect the development of the ventral stream, the occipitotemporal cortical regions that subserve face and object recognition. The present studies examined ventral stream function in WS, with the hypothesis that faces would produce a relatively more mature pattern of ventral occipitotemporal activation, relative to other objects that are also represented across these visual areas. Using functional magnetic imaging, we compared activation patterns during viewing of human faces, cat faces, houses and shoes in individuals with WS (age 14-27), typically developing 6-9-year-olds (matched approximately on mental age), and typically developing 14-26-year-olds (matched on chronological age). Typically developing individuals exhibited changes in the pattern of activation over age, consistent with previous reports. The ventral stream topography of individuals with WS differed from both control groups, however, reflecting the same level of activation to face stimuli as chronological age matches, but less activation to house stimuli than either mental age or chronological age matches. We discuss the possible causes of this unusual topography and implications for understanding the behavioral profile of people with WS.

Abstract: Several recent models of medial temporal lobe (MTL) function have proposed that the parahippocampal cortex processes context information, the perirhinal cortex processes item information, and the hippocampus binds together items and contexts. While evidence for a clear functional distinction between the perirhinal cortex and other regions within the MTL has been well supported, it has been less clear whether such a dissociation exists between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. In the current study, we use a novel approach applying a functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm to address these issues. During scanning, human subjects performed an incidental target detection task while viewing trial-unique sequentially presented pairs of natural scenes, each containing a single prominent object. We observed a striking double dissociation between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, with the former showing a selective sensitivity to changes in the spatial relationship between objects and their background context and the latter engaged only by scene novelty. Our findings provide compelling support for the hypothesis that rapid item-context binding is a function of the hippocampus, rather than the parahippocampal cortex, with the former acting to detect relational novelty of this nature through its function as a match-mismatch detector.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the human parietal and frontal cortices are involved in object image perception. We hypothesized that the parietal/frontal object areas play a role in differentiating the orientations (i.e., views) of an object. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared brain activations while human observers differentiated between two object images in depth-orientation (orientation task) and activations while they differentiated the images in object identity (identity task). The left intraparietal area, right angular gyrus, and right inferior frontal areas were activated more for the orientation task than for the identity task. The occipitotemporal object areas, however, were activated equally for the two tasks. No region showed greater activation for the identity task. These results suggested that the parietal/frontal object areas encode view-dependent visual features and underlie object orientation perception.

Abstract: OBJECT: Although a rarely reported occurrence, late failure of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) may occur in children as a result of a variety of factors. Delay in recognition of symptoms can lead to harmful deterioration in the patient's condition. The authors undertook this study to assess the capacity of cine phase-contrast MR imaging to identify late failure in asymptomatic pediatric patients treated with ETV for hydrocephalus. METHODS: This study was a retrospective evaluation of cases involving patients who underwent ETV between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2008, at the pediatric neurological surgery service of the University of Padua. Before 2004, patients were routinely followed up with cine MR imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months after ETV. In 2004, a protocol of annual cine MR follow-up was instituted as a result of a case of fatal late failure. The authors evaluated all cases of late failure identified through cine MR imaging and performed a statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between ETV failure and several variables, including the cause of hydrocephalus for which ETV was originally indicated. RESULTS: In a series of 84 patients (age range 6 days-16 years), 17 patients had early ETV failure. Of the remaining 67 patients, 5 (7%) were found to have no CSF flow through the fenestration and recurrent ventriculomegaly when assessed with cine MR imaging at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 years after ETV. The patient in whom ETV failure was identified 1 year postoperatively had Dandy-Walker malformation. The patients in whom ETV failure was identified 2, 3, and 4 years postoperatively all had undergone ETV for treatment of postinfective hydrocephalus. The patient in whom ETV failure was identified 7 years postoperatively had a cystic arachnopathy in the fourth ventricle after cerebellar astrocytoma removal. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo ETV for infective hydrocephalus and Dandy-Walker malformation should receive long-term follow-up, because late closure of the stoma may occur progressively and slowly. Intraoperative observation of thickened arachnoid membranes at the level of the interpeduncular cisterns at the first ETV and a progressive decreasing of CSF flow through the stoma on routine cine MR imaging should be considered unfavorable elements entailing a significant risk of deterioration.

Abstract: Visual working memory (VWM) is a capacity-limited cognitive resource that plays an important role in complex cognitive behaviors. Recent studies indicate that regions subserving VWM may play a role in the perception and recognition of visual objects, suggesting that conscious object perception may depend on the same cognitive and neural architecture that supports the maintenance of visual object information. In the present study, we examined this question by testing object processing under a concurrent VWM load. Under a high VWM load, recognition was impaired for objects presented in the left visual field, in particular when two objects were presented simultaneously. Multivariate fMRI revealed that two independent but partially overlapping networks of brain regions contribute to object recognition. The first network consisted of regions involved in VWM encoding and maintenance. Importantly, these regions were also sensitive to object load. The second network comprised regions of the ventral temporal lobes traditionally associated with object recognition. Importantly, activation in both networks predicted object recognition performance. These results indicate that information processing in regions that mediate VWM may be critical to conscious visual perception. Moreover, the observation of a hemifield asymmetry in object recognition performance has important theoretical and clinical significance for the study of visual neglect.

Abstract: Multisensory integration assists us to identify objects by providing multiple cues with respect to object category and spatial location. We used a semantic audiovisual object matching task to determine the effect of spatial congruency on response behavior and fMRI brain activation. Fifteen subjects responded in a four-alternative response paradigm, which visual quadrant contained the object best matched to the sound presented. Realistic sounds based on head-related transfer functions were presented binaurally with the simulated sound source corresponding to one of the four quadrants. Following a random sequence, the location of the sound corresponded to the quadrant containing the semantically congruent target on half the trials, whereas on other trials the sound arose from an incongruent location. We examined the effects of spatial congruency on response latencies, hit-rates and fMRI responses. Preliminary behavioral results revealed a significant effect of spatial congruency on response latency or performance for stimuli with noise added. In the fMRI experiment, spatial congruency had a significant effect on the BOLD response. A cluster in the right middle and superior temporal gyrus was more activated when the auditory sound sources were spatially congruent with the semantically matching visual stimulus. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis, in which we correlated the BOLD signal with the subjects' ability to locate the sound sources, we found a significant cluster in the left inferior frontal cortex, where the BOLD response increased with sound-source localization performance. Thus spatial congruency appears to enhance the semantic integration of audiovisual object information in these brain regions.

Abstract: While many motion correction techniques for MRI have been proposed, their use is often limited by increased patient preparation, decreased patient comfort, additional scan time, or the use of specialized sequences not available on many commercial scanners. For this reason, we propose a simple self-navigating technique designed to detect motion in segmented sequences. We demonstrate that comparing two segments containing adjacent sets of k-space lines results in an aliased error function. A global shift of the aliased error function indicates the presence of in-plane rigid-body translation, while other types of motion are evident in the dispersion or breadth of the error function. Since segmented sequences commonly acquire data in sets of adjacent k-space lines, this method provides these sequences with an inherent method of detecting object motion. Motion corrupted data can then be reacquired proactively or in some cases corrected or removed retrospectively.

Abstract: A recent view of cortical functional specialization suggests that the primary organizing principle of the cortex is based on task requirements, rather than sensory modality. Consistent with this view, recent evidence suggests that a region of the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LO) may process object shape information regardless of the modality of sensory input. There is considerable evidence that area LO is involved in processing visual and haptic shape information. However, sound can also carry acoustic cues to an object's shape, for example, when a sound is produced by an object's impact with a surface. Thus, the current study used auditory stimuli that were created from recordings of objects impacting a hard surface to test the hypothesis that area LO is also involved in auditory shape processing. The objects were of two shapes, rods and balls, and of two materials, metal and wood. Subjects were required to categorize the impact sounds in one of three tasks, (1) by the shape of the object while ignoring material, (2) by the material of the object while ignoring shape, or (3) by using all the information available. Area LO was more strongly recruited when subjects discriminated impact sounds based on the shape of the object that made them, compared to when subjects discriminated those same sounds based on material. The current findings suggest that activation in area LO is shape selective regardless of sensory input modality, and are consistent with an emerging theory of perceptual functional specialization of the brain that is task-based rather than sensory modality-based.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that medial-temporal lobe (MTL) damage, either from focal lesions or neurodegenerative disease (e.g., semantic dementia), impairs perception as well as long-term declarative memory. Notably, however, these two patient groups show different performance for meaningful versus unfamiliar stimuli. In amnesics with nonprogressive MTL lesions, the use of meaningful stimuli, compared with unfamiliar items, boosted discrimination performance. In semantic dementia, a condition characterized by progressive deterioration of conceptual knowledge in the context of anterolateral temporal lobe damage, performance for meaningful stimuli was equivalent to that for unfamiliar items. To further investigate these findings, we scanned healthy volunteers while they performed odd-one-out discriminations involving familiar (i.e., meaningful/famous) and unfamiliar (i.e., novel) objects and faces and a baseline task of size oddity. Outside the scanner, volunteers' recognition memory was assessed. We found above baseline activity in the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus for all object and face discriminations and above baseline activity in the temporal pole for all face discriminations. The comparison of meaningful, relative to novel, faces and objects, revealed increased activity in the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus. In the temporal pole, we also found activity related to meaningfulness for faces but not for objects. Importantly, these meaningfulness effects were evident even for discriminations that were not subsequently well remembered, suggesting that the difference between meaningful and novel stimuli reflects perceptual or conceptual processes rather than solely incidental encoding into long-term memory. The results provide further evidence that the MTL is recruited during complex perceptual discrimination and additionally suggest that these structures are recruited in semantic processing of objects and faces.

Abstract: A key challenge of object recognition is achieving a balance between selectivity for relevant features and invariance to irrelevant ones. Computational and cognitive models predict that optimal selectivity for features will differ by object, and here we investigate whether this is reflected in visual representations in the human ventral stream. We describe a new real-time neuroimaging method, dynamically adaptive imaging (DAI), that enabled measurement of neural selectivity along multiple feature dimensions in the neighborhood of single referent objects. The neural response evoked by a referent was compared to that evoked by 91 naturalistic objects using multi-voxel pattern analysis. Iteratively, the objects evoking the most similar responses were selected and presented again, to converge upon a subset that characterizes the referent's "neural neighborhood." This was used to derive the feature selectivity of the response. For three different referents, we found strikingly different selectivity, both in individual features and in the balance of tuning to sensory versus semantic features. Additional analyses placed a lower bound on the number of distinct activation patterns present. The results suggest that either the degree of specificity available for object representation in the ventral stream varies by class, or that different objects evoke different processing strategies.

Abstract: In this study, we show that top-down control mechanisms engaged during visual imagery of simple shapes (letters X and O) can selectively activate position-invariant perceptual codes in visual areas specialised for shape processing, including lateral occipital complex (LOC). First, we used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to identify visual cortical areas that code for shape within a position-invariant reference frame. Next, we examined the similarity between these high-level visual codes and patterns elicited while participants imagined the corresponding stimulus at central fixation. Our results demonstrate that imagery engages object-centred codes in higher-level visual areas. More generally, our results also demonstrate that top-down control mechanisms are able to generate highly specific patterns of visual activity in the absence of corresponding sensory input. We argue that a general model of top-down control must account for dynamic modulation of functional connectivity between high-level control centres and overlapping neural codes in visual cortex.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular amyloidosis is caused by amyloid accumulation in walls of blood vessel walls leading to hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive impairment. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression levels correlate with the degree of cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity in such cases is increased along the cerebral blood vessels. Here we show that a nasally administered proteosome-based adjuvant activates macrophages and decreases vascular amyloid in TGF-beta1 mice. Animals were nasally treated with a proteosome-based adjuvant on a weekly basis for 3 months beginning at age 13 months. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we found that while control animals showed a significant cerebrovascular pathology, proteosome-based adjuvant prevents further brain damage and prevents pathological changes in the blood-brain barrier. Using an object recognition test and Y-maze, we found significant improvement in cognition in the treated group. Our findings support the potential use of a macrophage immunomodulator as a novel approach to reduce cerebrovascular amyloid, prevent microhemorrhage, and improve cognition.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Support vector machine (SVM) has been widely used as accurate and reliable method to decipher brain patterns from functional MRI (fMRI) data. Previous studies have not found a clear benefit for non-linear (polynomial kernel) SVM versus linear one. Here, a more effective non-linear SVM using radial basis function (RBF) kernel is compared with linear SVM. Different from traditional studies which focused either merely on the evaluation of different types of SVM or the voxel selection methods, we aimed to investigate the overall performance of linear and RBF SVM for fMRI classification together with voxel selection schemes on classification accuracy and time-consuming. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six different voxel selection methods were employed to decide which voxels of fMRI data would be included in SVM classifiers with linear and RBF kernels in classifying 4-category objects. Then the overall performances of voxel selection and classification methods were compared. Results showed that: (1) Voxel selection had an important impact on the classification accuracy of the classifiers: in a relative low dimensional feature space, RBF SVM outperformed linear SVM significantly; in a relative high dimensional space, linear SVM performed better than its counterpart; (2) Considering the classification accuracy and time-consuming holistically, linear SVM with relative more voxels as features and RBF SVM with small set of voxels (after PCA) could achieve the better accuracy and cost shorter time. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present work provides the first empirical result of linear and RBF SVM in classification of fMRI data, combined with voxel selection methods. Based on the findings, if only classification accuracy was concerned, RBF SVM with appropriate small voxels and linear SVM with relative more voxels were two suggested solutions; if users concerned more about the computational time, RBF SVM with relative small set of voxels when part of the principal components were kept as features was a better choice.

Abstract: Professional musicians constitute a model par excellence for understanding experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain, particularly in the auditory domain. Their intensive sensorimotor experience with musical instruments has been shown to entail plastic brain alterations in cortical perceptual and motor maps. It remains an important question whether this neuroplasticity might extend beyond basic perceptual and motor functions and even shape higher-level conceptualizations by which we conceive our physical and social world. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that conceptual processing of visually presented musical instruments activates auditory association cortex encompassing right posterior superior temporal gyrus, as well as adjacent areas in the superior temporal sulcus and the upper part of middle temporal gyrus (pSTG/MTG) only in musicians, but not in musical laypersons. These areas in and adjacent to auditory association cortex were not only recruited by conceptual processing of musical instruments during visual object recognition, but also by auditory perception of real sounds. Hence, the unique intensive experience of musicians with musical instruments establishes a link between auditory perceptual and conceptual brain systems. Experience-driven neuroplasticity in musicians is thus not confined to alterations of perceptual and motor maps, but even leads to the establishment of higher-level semantic representations for musical instruments in and adjacent to auditory association cortex. These findings highlight the eminent importance of sensory and motor experience for acquiring rich concepts.

Abstract: During object manipulation the brain integrates the visual, auditory, and haptic experience of an object into a unified percept. Previous brain imaging studies have implicated for instance the dorsal part of the lateral occipital complex in visuo-tactile and the posterior superior temporal sulcus in audio-visual integration of object-related inputs (Amedi et al., 2005). Yet it is still unclear which brain regions represent object-specific information of all three sensory modalities. To address this question, we performed two complementary functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. In the first experiment, we identified brain regions which were consistently activated by unimodal visual, auditory, and haptic processing of manipulable objects relative to non-object control stimuli presented in the same modality. In the second experiment, we assessed regional brain activations when participants had to match object-related information that was presented simultaneously in two or all three modalities. Only a well-defined region in left fusiform gyrus (FG) showed an object-specific activation during unisensory processing in the visual, auditory, and tactile modalities. The same region was also consistently activated during multisensory matching of object-related information across all three senses. Taken together, our results suggest that this region is central to the recognition of manipulable objects. A putative role of this FG region is to unify object-specific information provided by the visual, auditory, and tactile modalities into trisensory object representations.

Abstract: Identifying and evaluating events which are novel in a particular environment is crucially important for adaptive behavior. These events are often not just novel, as they typically violate expectations which may be formulated based on numerous features of our surroundings, one of which includes the ordinal structure (temporal order) of relevant stimuli. Events which violate such expectations, namely sequential deviants, constitute one category of associatively novel stimuli. The present event-related fMRI study investigated the detection of sequential deviants presented within three types of equivalently organized, attended visual sequences which differed in stimulus dimensions relevant for defining the sequential structure (position, rhythm, and object identity). Presenting deviants within perceptual sequences defined by position and rhythm stimulus properties triggered comparable patterns of activations within the lateral parietal, premotor, and prefrontal regions. However, the activations identified in the context of position sequences showed a more dorsal distribution when compared to those in rhythm sequences. In contrast, detection of deviants within object sequences was supported by right-lateralized parietal and temporal cortices. Thus, although the obtained results indicate similarities and partial overlap in activations triggered by specific pairs of deviants, differences in their processing were also revealed. This suggests that the general task context and specific stimulus features which define the deviant itself influence which brain regions within a widespread network incorporating lateral prefrontal, anterior premotor, and posterior (mainly lateral parietal) areas will become engaged in its processing.

Abstract: Although vision is the primary sensory modality that humans and other primates use to identify objects in the environment, we can recognize crucial object features (e.g., shape, size) using the somatic modality. Previous studies have shown that the occipito-temporal areas dedicated to the visual processing of object forms, faces and bodies also show category-selective responses when the preferred stimuli are haptically explored out of view. Visual processing of human bodies engages specific areas in lateral (extrastriate body area, EBA) and medial (fusiform body area, FBA) occipito-temporal cortex. This study aimed at exploring the relative involvement of EBA and FBA in the haptic exploration of body parts. During fMRI scanning, participants were asked to haptically explore either real-size fake body parts or objects. We found a selective activation of right and left EBA, but not of right FBA, while participants haptically explored body parts as compared to real objects. This suggests that EBA may integrate visual body representations with somatosensory information regarding body parts and form a multimodal representation of the body. Furthermore, both left and right EBA showed a comparable level of body selectivity during haptic perception and visual imagery. However, right but not left EBA was more activated during haptic exploration than visual imagery of body parts, ruling out that the response to haptic body exploration was entirely due to the use of visual imagery. Overall, the results point to the existence of different multimodal body representations in the occipito-temporal cortex which are activated during perception and imagery of human body parts.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This paper studies the feasibility of developing an automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) system in clinical radiology and demonstrates its operation on clinical 2D images. METHODS: The anatomy recognition method described here consists of two main components: (a) multiobject generalization of OASM and (b) object recognition strategies. The OASM algorithm is generalized to multiple objects by including a model for each object and assigning a cost structure specific to each object in the spirit of live wire. The delineation of multiobject boundaries is done in MOASM via a three level dynamic programming algorithm, wherein the first level is at pixel level which aims to find optimal oriented boundary segments between successive landmarks, the second level is at landmark level which aims to find optimal location for the landmarks, and the third level is at the object level which aims to find optimal arrangement of object boundaries over all objects. The object recognition strategy attempts to find that pose vector (consisting of translation, rotation, and scale component) for the multiobject model that yields the smallest total boundary cost for all objects. The delineation and recognition accuracies were evaluated separately utilizing routine clinical chest CT, abdominal CT, and foot MRI data sets. The delineation accuracy was evaluated in terms of true and false positive volume fractions (TPVF and FPVF). The recognition accuracy was assessed (1) in terms of the size of the space of the pose vectors for the model assembly that yielded high delineation accuracy, (2) as a function of the number of objects and objects' distribution and size in the model, (3) in terms of the interdependence between delineation and recognition, and (4) in terms of the closeness of the optimum recognition result to the global optimum. RESULTS: When multiple objects are included in the model, the delineation accuracy in terms of TPVF can be improved to 97%-98% with a low FPVF of 0.1%-0.2%. Typically, a recognition accuracy of > or = 90% yielded a TPVF > or = 95% and FPVF < or = 0.5%. Over the three data sets and over all tested objects, in 97% of the cases, the optimal solutions found by the proposed method constituted the true global optimum. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results showed the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed automatic anatomy recognition system. Increasing the number of objects in the model can significantly improve both recognition and delineation accuracy. More spread out arrangement of objects in the model can lead to improved recognition and delineation accuracy. Including larger objects in the model also improved recognition and delineation. The proposed method almost always finds globally optimum solutions.

Abstract: Objects are more easily recognized in their typical context. However, is contextual information activated early enough to facilitate the perception of individual objects, or is contextual facilitation caused by postperceptual mechanisms? To elucidate this issue, we first need to study the temporal dynamics and neural interactions associated with contextual processing. Studies have shown that the contextual network consists of the parahippocampal, retrosplenial, and medial prefrontal cortices. We used functional MRI, magnetoencephalography, and phase synchrony analyses to compare the neural response to stimuli with strong or weak contextual associations. The context network was activated in functional MRI and preferentially synchronized in magnetoencephalography (MEG) for stimuli with strong contextual associations. Phase synchrony increased early (150-250 ms) only when it involved the parahippocampal cortex, whereas retrosplenial-medial prefrontal cortices synchrony was enhanced later (300-400 ms). These results describe the neural dynamics of context processing and suggest that context is activated early during object perception.

Abstract: The Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) is part of the left ventral visual stream that underlies the invariant identification of visual words. It remains debated whether this region is truly selective for words relative to common objects; why this particular part of the visual system is reproducibly engaged in reading; and whether reading expertise also relies on perceptual learning within earlier visual areas. In this fMRI study we matched written words and line-drawings of objects in luminance, contour length and number of features. We then compared them to control images made by scrambling procedures that kept local features intact. Greater responses to written words than to objects were found not only in the VWFA, but also in areas V1/V2 and V3v/V4. Furthermore, by contrasting stimuli reduced either to line junctions (vertices) or to line midsegments, we showed that the VWFA partially overlaps with regions of ventral visual cortex particularly sensitive to the presence of line junctions that are useful for object recognition. Our results indicate that preferential processing of written words can be observed at multiple levels of the visual system. It is possible that responses in early visual areas might be due to some remaining differences between words and controls not eliminated in the present stimuli. However, our results concur with recent comparisons of literates and illiterates and suggest that these early visual activations reflect the effects of perceptual learning under pressure for fast, parallel processing that is more prominent in reading than other visual cognitive processes.

Abstract: Our object recognition abilities, a direct product of our experience with objects, are fine-tuned to perfection. Left temporal and lateral areas along the dorsal, action related stream, as well as left infero-temporal areas along the ventral, object related stream are engaged in object recognition. Here we show that expertise modulates the activity of dorsal areas in the recognition of man-made objects with clearly specified functions. Expert chess players were faster than chess novices in identifying chess objects and their functional relations. Experts' advantage was domain-specific as there were no differences between groups in a control task featuring geometrical shapes. The pattern of eye movements supported the notion that experts' extensive knowledge about domain objects and their functions enabled superior recognition even when experts were not directly fixating the objects of interest. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) related exclusively the areas along the dorsal stream to chess specific object recognition. Besides the commonly involved left temporal and parietal lateral brain areas, we found that only in experts homologous areas on the right hemisphere were also engaged in chess specific object recognition. Based on these results, we discuss whether skilled object recognition does not only involve a more efficient version of the processes found in non-skilled recognition, but also qualitatively different cognitive processes which engage additional brain areas.

Abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a developing technology for low-cost noninvasive functional brain imaging. With multichannel optical instruments, it becomes possible to measure not only local changes in hemoglobin concentrations but also temporal correlations of those changes in different brain regions which gives an optical analog of functional connectivity traditionally measured by fMRI. We recorded hemodynamic activity during the Go-NoGo task from 11 right-handed subjects with probes placed bilaterally over prefrontal areas. Subjects were detecting animals as targets in natural scenes pressing a mouse button. Data were low-pass filtered<1 Hz and cardiacrespirationsuperficial layers artifacts were removed using Independent Component Analysis. Fisher's transformed correlations of poststimulus responses (30 s) were averaged over groups of channels unilaterally in each hemisphere (intrahemispheric connectivity) and the corresponding channels between hemispheres (interhemispheric connectivity). The hemodynamic response showed task-related activation (an increasedecrease in oxygenateddeoxygenated hemoglobin, respectively) greater in the right versus left hemisphere. Intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity was also significantly stronger during the task compared to baseline. Functional connectivity between the inferior and the middle frontal regions was significantly stronger in the right hemisphere. Our results demonstrate that optical methods can be used to detect transient changes in functional connectivity during rapid cognitive processes.

Abstract: To clarify whether the neural pathways concerning color processing are the same for natural objects, for artifacts objects and for non-objects we examined brain responses measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) during a covert naming task including the factors color (color vs. black&white (B&W)) and stimulus type (natural vs. artifacts vs. non-objects). Our results indicate that the superior parietal lobule and precuneus (BA 7) bilaterally, the right hippocampus and the right fusifom gyrus (V4) make part of a network responsible for color processing both for natural objects and artifacts, but not for non-objects. When color objects (both natural and artifacts) were contrasted with color non-objects we observed activations in the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 35/36), the superior parietal lobule (BA 7) bilaterally, the left inferior middle temporal region (BA 20/21) and the inferior and superior frontal regions (BA 10/11/47). These additional activations suggest that colored objects recruit brain regions that are related to visual semantic information/retrieval and brain regions related to visuo-spatial processing. Overall, the results suggest that color information is an attribute that can improve object recognition (behavioral results) and activate a specific neural network related to visual semantic information that is more extensive than for B&W objects during object recognition.

Abstract: Ventral occipito-temporal cortex is known to play a major role in visual object recognition. Still unknown is whether object familiarity and semantic domain are critical factors in its functional organization. Most models assume a functional locus where exemplars of familiar categories are represented: the structural description system. On the assumption that familiarity should modulate the effect of visual noise on form recognition, we attempted to individualize the structural description system by scanning healthy subjects while they looked at familiar (living and nonliving things) and novel 3-D objects, either with increasing or decreasing visual noise. Familiarity modulated the visual noise effect (particularly when familiar items were living things), revealing a substrate for the structural description system in right occipito-temporal cortex. These regions also responded preferentially to living as compared to nonliving items. Overall, these results suggest that living items are particularly reliant on the structural description system.

Abstract: Action observation engages higher motor areas, possibly reflecting an internal simulation. However, actions considered odd or unusual were found to trigger additional activity in the so-called theory of mind (ToM) network, pointing to deliberations on the actor's mental states. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, the hypothesis was tested that an allocentric perspective on a normal action, and even more so the sight of the actor's face, suffices to evoke ToM activity. Subjects observed short videos of object manipulation filmed from either the egocentric or the allocentric perspective, the latter including the actor's face in half of the trials. On the basis of a regions of interest analysis using ToM coordinates, we found increased neural activity in several regions of the ToM network. First, perceiving actions from an allocentric compared with the egocentric perspective enhanced activity in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Second, the presence of the actor's face enhanced activation in the TPJ bilaterally, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Finally, the mPFC and PCC showed increased responses when the actor changed with respect to the preceding trial. These findings were further corroborated by zmap findings for the latter two contrasts. Together, findings indicate that observation of normal everyday actions can engage ToM areas and that an allocentric perspective, seeing the actor's face and seeing a face switch, are effective triggers.

Abstract: We investigated brain activity associated with recognition of appropriate action selection based on allocentric perspectives using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The participants observed video clips in which one person (responder) passed one of three objects after a request by a second person (requester). The requester was unable to see one of the three objects because it was occluded by another object. Participants were asked to judge the appropriateness of the responder's action selection based on the visual information from the requester's perspective (i.e., allocentric perspective), not the responder's perspective (i.e., egocentric perspective). The experimental factors included the congruency of request interpretation and the appropriateness of action selection. The results showed that brain regions including the right temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) junction and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were more activated when the interpretation of the requested object differed between the egocentric and allocentric perspectives than when it was the same (the effect of incongruency for consistency). On the other hand, greater activation was found in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when the incongruency effect was compared only between the conditions of appropriate action selection (the interaction effect). These results suggest that both the TPO junction and IPL are involved in obtaining visual information from the allocentric perspective when visual information based on only the egocentric perspective is insufficient to interpret another person's request. The right DLPFC is likely related to this process to override the interference of action selection based on the egocentric perspective.

Abstract: Empirical and theoretical studies suggest that human knowledge is partly based on innate concepts that are experience-independent. We can, therefore, consider concepts underlying our knowledge as being broadly divided into inherited and acquired ones. Using fMRI, we studied the brain reaction in 20 subjects to violation of face, space (inherited), and artifact (acquired) concepts by presenting them with deformed faces, impossible figures (i.e., impossible chairs), and deformed planes, respectively, as well as their normal counterparts. Violation of the inherited concepts of face and space led to significant activation in frontoparietal cortex, whereas artifacts did not, thus distinguishing neurologically between the two categories. Participants were further exposed to these deformities daily for 1 month to test the supposition that inherited concepts are not modifiable, hence that prolonged exposure would not change the brain circuits that are engaged when viewing them. Consistent with this supposition, our results showed no significant change in activation for both categories, suggesting that such concepts are stable at the neural level at least within a time frame of 1 month. Finally, we investigated the regions of the brain that are critical for object representation. Our results show distinct and overlapping areas in the ventral visual cortex for all three categories, with faces activating the ventral visual cortex inferiorly, especially centered on right fusiform gyrus, and chairs and planes activating more diffuse regions, overlapping with the superior part of face region and mainly located in middle occipital cortex and parietal areas.

Abstract: We explored the extent to which biological motion perception depends on ventral stream integration by studying LG, an unusual case of developmental visual agnosia. LG has significant ventral stream processing deficits but no discernable structural cortical abnormality. LG's intermediate visual areas and object-sensitive regions exhibit abnormal activation during visual object perception, in contrast to area V5/MT+ which responds normally to visual motion (Gilaie-Dotan, Perry, Bonneh, Malach, & Bentin, 2009). Here, in three studies we used point light displays, which require visual integration, in adaptive threshold experiments to examine LG's ability to detect form from biological and non-biological motion cues. LG's ability to detect and discriminate form from biological motion was similar to healthy controls. In contrast, he was significantly deficient in processing form from non-biological motion. Thus, LG can rely on biological motion cues to perceive human forms, but is considerably impaired in extracting form from non-biological motion. Finally, we found that while LG viewed biological motion, activity in a network of brain regions associated with processing biological motion was functionally correlated with his V5/MT+ activity, indicating that normal inputs from V5/MT+ might suffice to activate his action perception system. These results indicate that processing of biologically moving form can dissociate from other form processing in the ventral pathway. Furthermore, the present results indicate that integrative ventral stream processing is necessary for uncompromised processing of non-biological form from motion.

Abstract: Faced with an overwhelming amount of sensory information, we are able to prioritize the processing of select spatial locations and visual features. The neuronal mechanisms underlying such spatial and feature-based selection have been studied in considerable detail. More recent work shows that attention can also be allocated to objects, even spatially superimposed objects composed of dynamically changing features that must be integrated to create a coherent object representation. Much less is known about the mechanisms underlying such object-based selection. Our goal was to investigate behavioral and neuronal responses when attention was directed to one of two objects, specifically one of two superimposed transparent surfaces, in a task designed to preclude space-based and feature-based selection. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals when attention was deployed to one or the other surface. We found that visual areas V1, V2, V3, V3A, and MT+ showed enhanced BOLD responses to translations of an attended relative to an unattended surface. These results reveal that visual areas as early as V1 can be modulated by attending to objects, even objects defined by dynamically changing elements. This provides definitive evidence in humans that early visual areas are involved in a seemingly high-order process. Furthermore, our results suggest that these early visual areas may participate in object-specific feature "binding," a process that seemingly must occur for an object or a surface to be the unit of attentional selection.

Abstract: The brain's plasticity in response to sensory deprivation and other perturbations is well established. While the functional properties of the reorganized areas are under vigorous investigation, the factors that constrain cortical reorganization remain poorly understood. One factor constraining such reorganization may be long-distance subcortical connectivity between relevant cortical regions-reorganization attempts to preserve the functionality of subcortical connections. Here we provide human neurophysiological evidence for the role of the subcortical connections in shaping cortical reorganization of the networks involved in object naming following perturbation of normal function. We used direct electrical stimulation (DES) during surgical removal of gliomas to identify the sites that are involved in naming different categories of objects. The sites that were selectively inhibited in naming either living or non-living objects were displaced relative to those observed with other subject populations, possibly reflecting cortical reorganization due to slowly evolving brain damage. Subcortical DES applied to the white matter underlying these regions also led to category-specific naming deficits. The existence of these subcortical fiber pathways was confirmed using diffusion tensor tractography. These results constitute the first neurophysiological evidence for the critical role of subcortical pathways as part of the neural circuits that are involved in object naming; they also highlight the importance of subcortical connectivity in shaping cortical reorganization following perturbations of normal function.

Abstract: Re-entrant circuits involving communication between the frontal cortex and other brain areas have been hypothesized to be necessary for maintaining the sustained patterns of neural activity that represent information in working memory, but evidence has so far been indirect. If working memory maintenance indeed depends on such temporally precise and robust long-distance communication, then performance on a delayed recognition task should be highly dependent on the microstructural integrity of white-matter tracts connecting sensory areas with prefrontal cortex. This study explored the effect of variations in white-matter microstructure on working memory performance in two separate groups of participants: patients with multiple sclerosis and age- and sex-matched healthy adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to reveal cortical regions involved in spatial and object working memory, which, in turn, were used to define specific frontal to extrastriate white-matter tracts of interest via diffusion tensor tractography. After factoring out variance due to age and the microstructure of a control tract (the corticospinal tract), the number of errors produced in the object working memory task was specifically related to the microstructure of the inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus. This result held for both groups, independently, providing a within-study replication with two different types of white-matter structural variability: multiple sclerosis-related damage and normal variation. The results demonstrate the importance of interactions between specific regions of the prefrontal cortex and sensory cortices for a nonspatial working memory task that preferentially activates those regions.

Abstract: Due to the scan time limitation, our MRI studies of the human tongue can acquire only a limited number of contiguous two-dimensional (2D) slices to form a volumetric data set in a given series. An interpolated three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction using images acquired in a single plane presents artifacts. To address this issue, we developed a wavelet-based bidirectional linear fusion method that uses slices acquired from sagittal and coronal planes to estimate the unknown values of the inter-slice voxels. We use an interpolation method to estimate the voxel value based on neighboring fiducial voxels in the bounding slices. This interpolation is followed by a wavelet fusion to recover image details by integrating prominent coefficients from the interpolated images. Our method was evaluated using 2D MR images and 3D phantoms. Experiments demonstrated that our method reduces interpolation artifacts and greatly improves the 3D reconstruction accuracy. The advantage of our method casts new light on MR imaging and image processing and permits us to achieve high resolution and short acquisition time simultaneously.

Abstract: We used a two stage procedure to predict which stroke patients would have chronic difficulties gesturing how to use an object when object recognition and hand movements were intact. First, we searched our PLORAS database by behavior and identified 5 patients who had chronic difficulty gesturing object use but no difficulty recognising objects, comprehending words or moving their hands. High definition lesion analyses showed that all 5 patients had damage to the white matter underlying the left ventral supramarginal gyrus, (A) close to the cortex, (B) deep towards the midline and (C) extending into the temporal lobe. In addition, 2 patients had damage to (D) the left posterior middle temporal cortex, and 3 patients had damage to (E) the left dorsal supramarginal gyrus and (F) the left premotor cortex. Second, we searched our database by lesion location for patients who had damage to any part of regions ABCDEF. The incidence of gesturing difficulties was higher in patients with damage to ABCD (7/9), ABCE (7/10) or ABCDE (10/13) than ABCF (7/13), ABC (8/16) or partial damage to ABCF (6/32). Thus behaviour was best predicted by the combination of regions that were damaged (a "network-lesion") rather than on the basis of each region alone or overall lesion size. Our results identify which parts of the temporal and parietal lobes impair the ability to gesture object use and which parts need to be intact to support it after damage. Our methods provide a framework for future studies aiming to predict the consequences of brain damage.

Abstract: The present neuroimaging study examines how repetition-related neural attenuation effects differ as a function of the perceptual similarity of the repetition and subsequent memory. One previous study (Turk-Browne et al., 2006) reported greater attenuation effects for subsequent hits than for misses. Another study (Wagner et al., 2000) found that neural attenuation is negatively correlated with subsequent memory. These opposing results suggest that repetition-related neural attenuation for subsequent hits and misses may be driven by different factors. In order to investigate the factors that affect the degree of neural attenuation, we varied perceptual similarity between repetitions in a scanned encoding phase that was followed by a subsequent memory test outside the scanner. We demonstrated that the degree of neural attenuation in the object processing regions depends on the interaction between perceptual similarity across repeated presentations and the quality their encodings. Specifically, the same areas that decreased neural signal for repetitions of same exemplars that were subsequently recognized with confidence that the repetitions were identical showed a decrease in neural signal for different-exemplar misses but not for the corresponding subsequently recognized hits. Our results imply that repetition-related neural attenuation should be related to the more efficient processing of perceptual properties of the stimuli only if subjects are able to subsequently remember the stimuli. Otherwise, the cause of attenuation may be in the failure to encode the stimuli on the second presentation as shown by the pattern of neural attenuation for the different-exemplar misses.

Abstract: Little is known about the neural reorganization that takes place subsequent to lesions that affect orthographic processing (reading and/or spelling). We report on an fMRI investigation of an individual with a left mid-fusiform resection that affected both reading and spelling (Tsapkini & Rapp, 2010). To investigate possible patterns of functional reorganization, we compared the behavioral and neural activation patterns of this individual with those of a group of control participants for the tasks of silent reading of words and pseudowords and the passive viewing of faces and objects, all tasks that typically recruit the inferior temporal lobes. This comparison was carried out with methods that included a novel application of Mahalanobis distance statistics, and revealed: (1) normal behavioral and neural responses for face and object processing, (2) evidence of neural reorganization bilaterally in the posterior fusiform that supported normal performance in pseudoword reading and which contributed to word reading (3) evidence of abnormal recruitment of the bilateral anterior temporal lobes indicating compensatory (albeit insufficient) recruitment of mechanisms for circumventing the word reading deficit.

Abstract: This study explored the correspondence between implicit memory and the reactivation of encoding-related brain regions. By using a classification method, we examined whether reactivation reflects only the similarities between study and test or voxels at the reactivated regions are diagnostic of facilitation in the implicit memory task. A simple detection task served as incidental encoding of object-location pairings. A subsequent visual search task served as the indirect (implicit) test of memory. Subjects did not know that their memory would be tested. Half of the subjects were unaware that some stimuli in the search task are the same as those that had appeared during the detection task. Another group of subjects was made aware of this relationship at the onset of the visual search task. Memory performance was superior for the study-test aware, compared to study-test unaware, subjects. Brain reactivation was calculated using a conjunction analysis implemented through overlaying the neural activity at encoding and testing. The conjunction analysis revealed that implicit memory in both groups of subjects was associated with reactivation of parietal and occipital brain regions. We were able to classify study-test aware and study-test unaware subjects based on the per-voxel reactivation values representing the neural dynamics between encoding and test. The classification results indicate that neural dynamics between encoding and test accounts for the differences in implicit memory. Overall, our study demonstrates that implicit memory performance requires and depends upon reactivation of encoding-related brain regions.

Abstract: Pattern recognition methods have become increasingly popular in fMRI data analysis, which are powerful in discriminating between multi-voxel patterns of brain activities associated with different mental states. However, when they are used in functional brain mapping, the location of discriminative voxels varies significantly, raising difficulties in interpreting the locus of the effect. Here we proposed a hierarchical framework of multivariate approach that maps informative clusters rather than voxels to achieve reliable functional brain mapping without compromising the discriminative power. In particular, we first searched for local homogeneous clusters that consisted of voxels with similar response profiles. Then, a multi-voxel classifier was built for each cluster to extract discriminative information from the multi-voxel patterns. Finally, through multivariate ranking, outputs from the classifiers were served as a multi-cluster pattern to identify informative clusters by examining interactions among clusters. Results from both simulated and real fMRI data demonstrated that this hierarchical approach showed better performance in the robustness of functional brain mapping than traditional voxel-based multivariate methods. In addition, the mapped clusters were highly overlapped for two perceptually equivalent object categories, further confirming the validity of our approach. In short, the hierarchical framework of multivariate approach is suitable for both pattern classification and brain mapping in fMRI studies.

Abstract: Regions tuned to individual visual categories, such as faces and objects, have been discovered in the later stages of the ventral visual pathway in the cortex. But most visual experience is composed of scenes, where multiple objects are interacting. Such interactions are readily described by prepositions or verb forms, for example, a bird perched on a birdhouse. At what stage in the pathway does sensitivity to such interactions arise? Here we report that object pairs shown as interacting, compared with their side-by-side depiction (e.g., a bird besides a birdhouse), elicit greater activity in the lateral occipital complex, the earliest cortical region where shape is distinguished from texture. Novelty of the interactions magnified this gain, an effect that was absent in the side-by-side depictions. Scene-like relations are thus likely achieved simultaneously with the specification of object shape.

Abstract: In natural images, visual objects are typically occluded by other objects. A remarkable ability of our visual system is to complete occluded objects effortlessly and see whole, uninterrupted objects. How object completion is implemented in the visual system is still largely unknown. In this study, using a backward masking paradigm, we combined psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the temporal evolvement of face completion at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. Human subjects were presented with two kinds of stimuli that were designed to elicit or not elicit the percept of a completed face, although they were physically very similar. By contrasting subjects' behavioral and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to completed and noncompleted faces, we measured the psychophysical time course of the face completion and its underlying cortical dynamics. We found that face completion manifested its effect between 50 and 250 ms after stimulus onset. Relative to noncompleted faces, completed faces induced weaker BOLD response at early processing phases in retinotopic visual areas V1 and V2 and stronger BOLD response at late processing phases in occipital face area and fusiform face area. Attending away from the stimuli largely abolished these effects. These findings suggest that face completion consists of two synergetic phases: early suppression in lower visual areas and late enhancement in higher visual areas; moreover, attention is necessary to these neural events.

Abstract: The surface area of human primary visual cortex (V1) varies substantially between individuals for unknown reasons. We found that this variability was strongly and negatively correlated with the magnitude of two common visual illusions, where two physically identical objects appear different in size as a result of their context. Because such illusions dissociate conscious perception from physical stimulation, our findings indicate that the surface area of V1 predicts variability in conscious experience.

Abstract: The effect of magnetic fields on the brain is a matter of debate. The objective of this study was to investigate whether repeated exposure to strong magnetic fields, such as during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could elicit changes in the developing rat brain. Embryonic day 15 (E15) and postnatal day 14 (P14) rats were exposed to MRI using a 7.05 T MR system. The animals were anesthetized and exposed for 35 min per day for 4 successive days. Control animals were anesthetized but no MRI was performed. Body temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C. BrdU was injected after each session (50 mg/kg). One month later, cell proliferation, neurogenesis and astrogenesis in the dentate gyrus were evaluated, revealing no effects of MRI, neither in the E15, nor in the P14 group. DNA damage in the dentate gyrus in the P14 group was evaluated on P18, 1 day after the last session, using TUNEL staining. There was no difference in the number of TUNEL-positive cells after MRI compared with controls, neither in mature neurons, nor in newborn progenitors (BrdU/TUNEL double-labeled cells). Novel object recognition was performed to assess memory function 1 month after MRI. There was no difference in the recognition index observed after MRI compared with the control rats, neither for the E15, nor for the P14 group. In conclusion, repeated exposure to MRI did not appear to affect neurogenesis, cell death or memory function in rats, neither in late gestation (E15-E18) nor in young postnatal (P14-P17) rats.

Abstract: In this article, we describe a detailed method for automatically generating tetrahedral meshes from 3D images having multiple region labels. An adaptively sized tetrahedral mesh modeling approach is described that is capable of producing meshes conforming precisely to the voxelized regions in the image. Efficient tetrahedral mesh improvement is then performed minimizing an energy function containing three terms: a smoothing term to remove the voxelization, a fidelity term to maintain continuity with the image data, and a novel elasticity term to prevent the tetrahedra from becoming flattened or inverted as the mesh deforms while allowing the voxelization to be removed entirely. The meshing algorithm is applied to structural MR image data that has been automatically segmented into 56 neuroanatomical sub-divisions as well as on two other examples. The resulting tetrahedral representation has several desirable properties such as tetrahedra with dihedral angles away from 0 and 180 degrees, smoothness, and a high resolution. Tetrahedral modeling via the approach described here has applications in modeling brain structure in normal as well as diseased brain in human and non-human data and facilitates examination of 3D object deformations resulting from neurological illness (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), development, and/or aging.

Abstract: Prior work has demonstrated a unique network involving the insula, temporal cortex, and precuneus in evaluating appropriate relationships between tool-object pairings under instruction [20]. However, are there automatic tendencies to evaluate appropriate tool-object pairings? Using electroencephalography (EEG), we emulated our prior work to identify neural mechanisms that, in the absence of task-related consciousness, differentiate functionally matching from mismatching tool-object pairs. This was compared to any activation consistent with this using environmental image pairs. In addition, based on the paradigm we were able to discern any naive processes that distinguish tools from non-tool environmental images. Results show that without task-related consciousness, the left occipitotemporal gyrus is preferentially active for tools compared to environmental images. Tool-object match and mismatch each versus control images show differences relative to a control image over the left temporal cortex, extending into the insula, yet there was no difference between tool-object match and mismatch. This suggests that there is no clear neural mechanism for continual evaluation of tool matching from mismatching, though there is for broad picture classifications. Taken together with our previous results, this creates a discussion for the role of intention when determining such relationships.

Abstract: Sensory information in the retinal image is typically too ambiguous to support visual object recognition by itself. Theories of visual disambiguation posit that to disambiguate, and thus interpret, the incoming images, the visual system must integrate the sensory information with previous knowledge of the visual world. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of human subjects, we have found evidence for functional specialization for storing disambiguating information in memory versus interpreting incoming ambiguous images. Subjects viewed two-tone, "Mooney" images, which are typically ambiguous when seen for the first time but are quickly disambiguated after viewing the corresponding unambiguous color images. Activity in one set of regions, including a region in the medial parietal cortex previously reported to play a key role in Mooney image disambiguation, closely reflected memory for previously seen color images but not the subsequent disambiguation of Mooney images. A second set of regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, showed the opposite pattern, in that their responses closely reflected the subjects' percepts of the disambiguated Mooney images on a stimulus-to-stimulus basis but not the memory of the corresponding color images. Functional connectivity between the two sets of regions was stronger during those trials in which the disambiguated percept was stronger. This functional interaction between brain regions that specialize in storing disambiguating information in memory versus interpreting incoming ambiguous images may represent a general mechanism by which previous knowledge disambiguates visual sensory information.

Abstract: We explored how developing neural artifact and animal representations in the dorsal and ventral stream play a role in children's increasingly more proficient interactions with objects. In thirty-three 6- to 10-year-old children and 11 adults, we used fMRI to track the development of (1) the cortical category preference for tools compared to animals and (2) the response to complex objects (as compared to scrambled objects) during a passive viewing task. In addition, we related a cognitive skill that improved substantially from age 6 to 10, namely the ability to recognize tools from unusual viewpoints, to the development of cortical object processing. In multiple complementary analyses we showed that those children who were better at recognizing tools from unusual viewpoints outside the scanner showed a reduced cortical response to tools and animals when viewed inside the scanner, bilaterally in intraparietal and inferotemporal cortex. In contrast, the cortical preference for tools in the dorsal and ventral visual stream did not predict object recognition performance, and was organized in an adult-like manner at six. While cortical tool preference did not change with age, the findings suggest that animal-preferring regions in the ventral visual stream may develop later, concordant with previous reports of a protracted development in similar regions for faces. We thus conclude that intraparietal and inferotemporal cortical networks that support aspects of object processing irrespective of tool or animal category, continue to develop during the school-age years and contribute to the development of object recognition skills during this period.

Abstract: Sometimes object detection as opposed to identification is sufficient to initiate the appropriate action. To explore the neural origin of behavioural differences between the two tasks, we combine psychophysical measurements and fMRI, specifically contrasting shape detection versus identification of a figure. This figure consisted of Gabor elements being oriented differently from those in the background. We equalized performance levels for detection and identification by adjusting orientation differences accordingly for each observer. Hence, stimulus saliency was constant for both tasks allowing a differentiation between the activations specific for detection versus identification processes. Identification yielded higher psychophysical thresholds, slower reaction times and increased hemodynamic activations in the lateral-occipital complex (LOC) and an adjacent area in the collateral sulcus (CoS). Additional analysis using cortex-based alignment revealed four voxel-clusters differentially activated by the tasks, situated in the inferior parietal lobe, the precuneus, the anterior cingulum and the medial frontal gyrus. Our results indicate partly separated cortical mechanisms for object detection and identification.

Abstract: Comparing experts with novices offers unique insights into the functioning of cognition, based on the maximization of individual differences. Here we used this expertise approach to disentangle the mechanisms and neural basis behind two processes that contribute to everyday expertise: object and pattern recognition. We compared chess experts and novices performing chess-related and -unrelated (visual) search tasks. As expected, the superiority of experts was limited to the chess-specific task, as there were no differences in a control task that used the same chess stimuli but did not require chess-specific recognition. The analysis of eye movements showed that experts immediately and exclusively focused on the relevant aspects in the chess task, whereas novices also examined irrelevant aspects. With random chess positions, when pattern knowledge could not be used to guide perception, experts nevertheless maintained an advantage. Experts' superior domain-specific parafoveal vision, a consequence of their knowledge about individual domain-specific symbols, enabled improved object recognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging corroborated this differentiation between object and pattern recognition and showed that chess-specific object recognition was accompanied by bilateral activation of the occipitotemporal junction, whereas chess-specific pattern recognition was related to bilateral activations in the middle part of the collateral sulci. Using the expertise approach together with carefully chosen controls and multiple dependent measures, we identified object and pattern recognition as two essential cognitive processes in expert visual cognition, which may also help to explain the mechanisms of everyday perception.

Abstract: Environmental events produce many sensory cues for identifying the action that evoked the event, the agent that performed the action, and the object targeted by the action. The cues for identifying environmental events are usually distributed across multiple sensory systems. Thus, to understand how environmental events are recognized requires an understanding of the fundamental cognitive and neural processes involved in multisensory object and action recognition. Here, we investigated the neural substrates involved in auditory and visual recognition of object-directed actions. Consistent with previous work on visual recognition of isolated objects, visual recognition of actions, and recognition of environmental sounds, we found evidence for multisensory audiovisual event-selective activation bilaterally at the junction of the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the lateral occipital cortex, the left superior temporal sulcus, and bilaterally in the intraparietal sulcus. The results suggest that recognition of events through convergence of visual and auditory cues is accomplished through a network of brain regions that was previously implicated only in visual recognition of action.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Conventional assessments of consciousness rely on motor responses to indicate awareness. However, overt behaviors may be absent or ambiguous in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) resulting in underrating capacity for cognition. fMRI during a silent picture-naming task was evaluated as an indicator of command following when conventional methods are not sufficient. METHODS: A total of 10 patients with and without conventional evidence of awareness, who met diagnostic criteria for the minimally conscious state (MCS) (n = 5), vegetative state (VS) (n = 3), emerged from MCS (EMCS) (n = 1), and locked-in syndrome (LIS) (n = 1), participated in this observational fMRI study. RESULTS: The LIS and EMCS patients engaged a complete network of essential language-related regions during the object-naming task. The MCS and 2 of the VS patients demonstrated both complete and partial preservation of the object-naming system. Patients who engaged a complete network scored highest on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the view that fMRI during object naming can elicit brain activations in patients with DOC similar to those observed in healthy subjects during command following, and patients can be stratified by completeness of the engaged neural system. These results suggest that activity of the language network may serve as an indicator of high-level cognition and possibly volitional processes that cannot be discerned through conventional behavioral assessment alone.

Abstract: We investigated the neural representation of observed actions in the human parietal and premotor cortex, which comprise the action observation network or the mirror neuron system for action recognition. Participants observed object-directed hand actions, in which action as well as other properties were independently manipulated: action (grasp or touch), object (cup or bottle), perspective (1st or 3rd person), hand (right or left), and image size (large or small). We then used multi-voxel pattern analysis to determine whether each feature could be correctly decoded from regional activities. The early visual area showed significant above-chance classification accuracy, particularly high in perspective, hand, and size, consistent with pixel-wise dissimilarity of stimuli. In contrast, the highest decoding accuracy for action was observed in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). Moreover, the decoder for action could be correctly generalized for images with high dissimilarity in the parietal and premotor region, but not in the visual area. Our study indicates that the parietal and premotor regions encode observed actions independent of retinal variations, which may subserve our capacity for invariant action recognition of others.

Abstract: Evidence from human and non-human primate studies supports a dual-pathway model of audition, with partially segregated cortical networks for sound recognition and sound localisation, referred to as the What and Where processing streams. In normal subjects, these two networks overlap partially on the supra-temporal plane, suggesting that some early-stage auditory areas are involved in processing of either auditory feature alone or of both. Using high-resolution 7-T fMRI we have investigated the influence of positional information on sound object representations by comparing activation patterns to environmental sounds lateralised to the right or left ear. While unilaterally presented sounds induced bilateral activation, small clusters in specific non-primary auditory areas were significantly more activated by contra-laterally presented stimuli. Comparison of these data with histologically identified non-primary auditory areas suggests that the coding of sound objects within early-stage auditory areas lateral and posterior to primary auditory cortex AI is modulated by the position of the sound, while that within anterior areas is not.

Abstract: The precuneus is part of the default network of the human brain, which exhibits a high level of activity during the resting state and lower activity during task-related behavior. Typically, the posterior midline areas show this characteristic response in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjects exhibit a lack of this typical deactivation. The interpretation of these findings, however, is obfuscated by the presence of local pathology and atrophy in AD. In contrast to AD, in patients with early frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the precuneus is virtually free of local neuropathology. In this study, we demonstrate reduced fMRI signal in the precuneus in a group of patients with FTLD during a confrontation naming task. We show that this effect in FTLD patients was (1) similar to that observed in AD and MCI and (2) not related to the degree of gray matter atrophy in the precuneus. We hypothesize that reduced deactivation of the default network is not related to local pathology but to a lack of connectivity, which decreases in both FTLD and AD, the major cortical dementias.

Abstract: The components of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) receive different kinds of input. The perirhinal cortex receives primarily object/item information, the parahippocampal cortex receives contextual information, and the hippocampus receives high-level inputs that include object/item, context, and other information. Critically, the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices have similar cytoarchitectonics, which differ considerably from that of the hippocampus and suggest that these cortices process their inputs differently from the way that the hippocampus processes its inputs. Much evidence indicates that the hippocampus is designed to rapidly bind together pattern-separated representations that support recall/recollection well. In contrast, the newer MTL cortices rapidly create poorly pattern-separated memories that support familiarity well, but recall/recollection very poorly. For over a decade, there has been disagreement about whether recall/recollection is primarily mediated by the hippocampus and familiarity by the evolutionarily newer MTL cortices or whether the MTL mediates these kinds of memory in an integrated, homogeneous fashion. Common misconceptions about familiarity, recollection, item, and associative memory are discussed as are methodological problems with MTL lesion and functional imaging research. The possible confound of familiarity with weaker memory and recollection with stronger memory is discussed and the implications of the Montaldi et al. (2006) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, which matched memory strength between strong familiarity and recollection, finding that only recollection activated the hippocampus, are discussed. A suggestion is made about how the long-running conflict of findings in the human hippocampal lesion literature may be resolved.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that imagined perspective rotations elicit spatial and low-level cortical motor areas of the brain when participants rely on knowledge of their physical body, or body percept (Wraga, Flynn, Boyle, & Evans, 2010). The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether recruitment of the body percept would activate low-level cortical motor areas of the brain within other classes of mental transformations. Participants performed imagined object and perspective rotations of three-dimensional Shephard-Metzler (1971) stimuli. For each task, participants used button presses serving as virtual pointers to locate a prescribed portion of the stimuli with respect to their "right" and "left." We found low-level cortical motor activation (M1) for both mental transformations; however, the degree to which such activation related to participants' performance differed, as well as the recruitment of additional nonmotoric strategies. The results are discussed in terms of recent hypotheses regarding the role of the body percept in extrinsically encoded mental transformations.

Abstract: OBJECT: Foraminal stenosis is a common cause of lumbar radicular symptoms. Recognition of the dynamic pathology, as well as the static anatomical changes, is important to achieving successful surgical outcomes. Excessive facet and anulus removal leads to subsequent disc space narrowing and/or segmental instability, which can cause poor results after decompressive surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the paraspinal-approach transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) in the treatment of lumbar foraminal stenosis. METHODS: Twenty levels of lumbar foraminal stenosis in 16 patients were treated using an instrumented paraspinal-approach TLIF. There were 12 single-level and 4 two-level cases. Pathologies included foraminal stenosis at 13 levels and lateral disc herniation with disc space narrowing at 7. RESULTS: In all patients, preoperative radicular symptoms and mechanical low-back pain were resolved immediately after the operation and leg weakness improved gradually. The recovery rate using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was 89.1%. Bony union was achieved within 6 months after the operation in all cases. Postoperative MR imaging showed minimal changes in the paraspinal muscles in the single-level cases. CONCLUSIONS: The paraspinal-approach TLIF is a minimally invasive, safe, and secure procedure for treating lumbar foraminal lesions. Direct visualization and decompression for the foraminal lesion, distraction of the collapsed disc space, and stabilization of the unstable segments can be achieved simultaneously through the paraspinal approach, which produces successful clinical and radiological results.

Abstract: Object categorization during ambiguous sensory stimulation generally depends on the activity of extrastriate sensory areas as well as top-down information. Both reflect internal representations of prototypical object knowledge against which incoming sensory information is compared. However, besides these general mechanisms, individuals might differ in their readiness to impose internal representations onto incoming ambiguous information. These individual differences might be based on what was referred to as "Schema Instantiation Threshold" (SIT; Lewicki et al. [1992]: Am Pshycol 47:796-801), defining a continuum from very rapid (low threshold) to a rather controlled application of internal representations (high threshold). We collected fMRI scans while subjects with low SIT ("internal encoders") and subjects with high SIT ("external encoders") made gender categorizations of ambiguous facial images. Internal encoders made faster gender decisions during high sensory ambiguity, showed higher fusiform activity, and had faster BOLD responses in the fusiform (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA) indicating a faster and stronger application of face-gender representations due to a low SIT threshold. External encoders made slower gender decisions and showed increased medial frontal activity, indicating a more controlled strategy during gender categorizations and increased decisional uncertainties. Internal encoders showed higher functional connectivity of the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) to seed activity in the FFA which might indicate both more readily generated predictive classificatory guesses and the subjective impressions of accurate classifications. Taken together, an "internal encoding style" is characterized by the fast, unsupervised and unverified application of primary object representations, whereas the opposite seems evident for subjects with an "external encoding style".

Abstract: Morphology of anatomical structures can provide important diagnostic information regarding disease. Implicit features of morphology, such as contour smoothness or perimeter-to-area ratio, have been used in the context of computerized decision support classifiers to aid disease diagnosis. These features are usually specific to the domain and application (e.g., margin irregularity is a predictor of malignant breast lesions on DCE-MRI). In this paper we present a framework for extracting Diffeomorphic Based Similarity (DBS) features to capture subtle morphometric differences between shapes that may not be captured by implicit features. Object morphology is represented using the medial axis model and objects are compared by determining correspondences between medial axis models using a cluster-based diffeomorphic registration scheme. To visualize and classify morphometric differences, a manifold learning scheme (Graph Embedding) is employed to identify nonlinear dependencies between medial axis model similarity and calculate DBS. We evaluated our DBS on two clinical problems discriminating: (a) different Gleason grades of prostate cancer using gland morphology on a set of 102 images, and (b) benign and malignant lesions on 44 breast DCE-MRI studies. Precision-recall curves demonstrate DBS features are better able to classify shapes belonging to the same class compared to implicit features. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes utilizing DBS. SVM accuracy was 83 +/- 4.47% for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions on breast DCE-MRI and over 80% in distinguishing between intermediate Gleason grades of prostate cancer on digitized histology.

Abstract: Abstract. A promising approach for the automatic classification of normal and acute rejection transplants from Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is proposed. The proposed approach consists of three main steps. The first step segments the kidney from the surrounding abdominal tissues by a level-set based deformable model with a speed function that accounts for a learned spatially variant statistical shape prior, 1st-order visual appearance descriptors of the contour interior and exterior (associated with the object and background, respectively), and a spatially invariant 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor. In the second step, to handle local object deformations due to kidney motion caused by patient breathing, we proposed a new nonrigid approach to align the object by solving Laplace's equation between closed equis-paced contours (iso-contours) of the reference and target objects. Finally, the perfusion curves that show the transportation of the contrast agent into the tissue are obtained from the segmented kidneys and used in the classification of normal and acute rejection transplants. Applications of the proposed approach yield promising results that would, in the near future, replace the use of current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography, which are not specific enough to determine the type of kidney dysfunction.

Abstract: We present an extensive investigation (24 experiments) of a new case of prosopagnosia following right unilateral damage, GG, with the aim of addressing two classical issues: (1) Can a visual recognition impairment truly be specific to faces? (2) What is the nature of acquired prosopagnosia? We show that GG recognizes nonface objects perfectly and quickly, even when it requires fine-grained analysis to individualize these objects. He is also capable of perceiving objects and faces as integrated wholes, as indicated by normal Navon effect, 3D-figures perception and perception of Mooney and Arcimboldo face stimuli. However, the patient could not perceive individual faces holistically, showing no inversion, composite, or whole-part advantage effects for faces. We conclude that an occipito-temporal right hemisphere lesion may lead to a specific impairment of holistic perception of individual items, a function that appears critical for normal face recognition but not for object recognition.

Abstract: Case A.C.A. presented an associated impairment of visual recognition and semantic knowledge for celebrities and biological objects. This case was relevant for (a) the neuroanatomical correlations, and (b) the relationship between visual recognition and semantics within the biological domain and the conspecifics domain. A.C.A. was not affected by anterior temporal damage. Her bilateral vascular lesions were localized on the medial and inferior temporal gyrus on the right and on the intermediate fusiform gyrus on the left, without concomitant lesions of the parahippocampal gyrus or posterior fusiform. Data analysis was based on a novel methodology developed to estimate the rate of stored items in the visual structural description system (SDS) or in the face recognition unit. For each biological object, no particular correlation was found between the visual information accessed through the semantic system and that tapped by the picture reality judgement. Findings are discussed with reference to whether a putative resource commonality is likely between biological objects and conspecifics, and whether or not either category may depend on an exclusive neural substrate.

Abstract: Neuropsychological evidence has highlighted the role of the anterior temporal lobes in the processing of conceptual knowledge. That putative role is only beginning to be investigated with fMRI as methodological advances are able to compensate for well-known susceptibility artifacts that affect the quality of the BOLD signal. In this article, we described differential BOLD activation for pictures of animals and manipulable objects in the anterior temporal lobes, consistent with previous neuropsychological findings. Furthermore, we found that the pattern of BOLD signal in the anterior temporal lobes is qualitatively different from that in the fusiform gyri. The latter regions are activated to different extents but always above baseline by images of the preferred and of the nonpreferred categories, whereas the anterior temporal lobes tend to be activated by images of the preferred category and deactivated (BOLD below baseline) by images of the nonpreferred category. In our experimental design, we also manipulated the decision that participants made over stimuli from the different semantic categories. We found that in the right temporal pole, the BOLD signal shows some evidence of being modulated by the task that participants were asked to perform, whereas BOLD activity in more posterior regions (e.g., the fusiform gyri) is not modulated by the task. These results reconcile the fMRI literature with the neuropsychological findings of deficits for animals after damage to the right temporal pole and suggest that anterior and posterior regions within the temporal lobes involved in object processing perform qualitatively different computations.

Abstract: The reduced neural response in certain brain regions when a task-relevant stimulus is repeated ("repetition suppression", RS) is often attributed to facilitation of the cognitive processes performed in those regions. Repetition of visual objects is associated with RS in the ventral and lateral occipital/temporal regions, and is typically attributed to facilitation of visual processes, ranging from the extraction of shape to the perceptual identification of objects. In two fMRI experiments using a semantic classification task, we found RS in a left lateral occipital/inferior temporal region to a picture of an object when the name of that object had previously been presented in a separate session. In other words, we found RS despite negligible visual similarity between the initial and repeated occurrences of an object identity. There was no evidence that this RS was driven by the learning of task-specific responses to an object identity ("S-R learning"). We consider several explanations of this occipitotemporal RS, such as phonological retrieval, semantic retrieval, and visual imagery. Although no explanation if fully satisfactory, it is proposed that such effects most plausibly relate to the extraction of task-relevant information relating to object size, either through the extraction of sensory-specific semantic information or through visual imagery processes. Our findings serve to emphasize the potential complexity of processing within traditionally visual regions, at least as measured by fMRI.

Abstract: In contrast to visual object processing, relatively little is known about how the human brain processes everyday real-world sounds, transforming highly complex acoustic signals into representations of meaningful events or auditory objects. We recently reported a fourfold cortical dissociation for representing action (nonvocalization) sounds correctly categorized as having been produced by human, animal, mechanical, or environmental sources. However, it was unclear how consistent those network representations were across individuals, given potential differences between each participant's degree of familiarity with the studied sounds. Moreover, it was unclear what, if any, auditory perceptual attributes might further distinguish the four conceptual sound-source categories, potentially revealing what might drive the cortical network organization for representing acoustic knowledge. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test participants before and after extensive listening experience with action sounds, and tested for cortices that might be sensitive to each of three different high-level perceptual attributes relating to how a listener associates or interacts with the sound source. These included the sound's perceived concreteness, effectuality (ability to be affected by the listener), and spatial scale. Despite some variation of networks for environmental sounds, our results verified the stability of a fourfold dissociation of category-specific networks for real-world action sounds both before and after familiarity training. Additionally, we identified cortical regions parametrically modulated by each of the three high-level perceptual sound attributes. We propose that these attributes contribute to the network-level encoding of category-specific acoustic knowledge representations.

Abstract: Previous studies have argued that faces and other objects are encoded in terms of their deviation from a class prototype or norm. This prototype is associated with a smaller neural population response compared with nonprototype objects. However, it is still unclear (1) whether a norm-based representation can emerge for unfamiliar or novel object classes through visual experience at the time scale of an experiment and (2) whether the results from previous studies are caused by the prototypicality of a stimulus, by the physical properties of individual stimuli independent from the stimulus distribution, and/or by the trial-to-trial adaptation. Here we show with a combined behavioral and event-related fMRI study in humans that a short amount of visual experience with exemplars from novel object classes determines which stimulus is represented as the norm. Prototypicality effects were observed at the behavioral level by behavioral asymmetries during a stimulus comparison task. The fMRI data revealed that class exemplars closest to the prototypes--the perceived average of each class--were associated with a smaller response in the anterior part of the visual object-selective cortex compared with other class exemplars. By dissociating between the physical characteristics and the prototypicality status of the stimuli and by controlling for trial-to-trial adaptation, we can firmly conclude for the first time that high-level visual areas represent the identity of exemplars using a dynamic, norm-based encoding principle.

Abstract: In three neuroimaging experiments, face, novel object, and building stimuli were compared under conditions of restricted (aperture) viewing and normal (whole) viewing. Aperture viewing restricted the view to a single face/object feature at a time, with the subjects able to move the aperture continuously though time to reveal different features. An analysis of the proportion of time spent viewing different features showed stereotypical exploration patterns for face, object, and building stimuli, and suggested that subjects constrained their viewing to the features most relevant for recognition. Aperture viewing showed much longer response times than whole viewing, due to sequential exploration of the relevant isolated features. An analysis of BOLD activation revealed face-selective activation with both whole viewing and aperture viewing in the left and right fusiform face areas (FFA). Aperture viewing showed strong and sustained activation throughout exploration, suggesting that aperture viewing recruited similar processes as whole viewing, but for a longer time period. Face-selective recruitment of the FFA with aperture viewing suggests that the FFA is involved in the integration of isolated features for the purpose of recognition.

Abstract: Our environments are highly regular in terms of when and where objects appear relative to each other. Statistical learning allows us to extract and represent these regularities, but how this knowledge is used by the brain during ongoing perception is unclear. We used rapid event-related fMRI to measure hemodynamic responses to individual visual images in a continuous stream that contained sequential contingencies. Sixteen human observers encountered these statistical regularities while performing an unrelated cognitive task, and were unaware of their existence. Nevertheless, the right anterior hippocampus showed greater hemodynamic responses to predictive stimuli, providing evidence for implicit anticipation as a consequence of unsupervised statistical learning. Hippocampal anticipation based on predictive stimuli correlated with subsequent processing of the predicted stimuli in occipital and parietal cortex, and anticipation in additional brain regions correlated with facilitated object recognition as reflected in behavioral priming. Additional analyses suggested that implicit perceptual anticipation does not contribute to explicit familiarity, but can result in predictive potentiation of category-selective ventral visual cortex. Overall, these findings show that future-oriented processing can arise incidentally during the perception of statistical regularities.

Abstract: Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of the human object recognition system commonly identify object-selective cortical regions by comparing blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to objects versus those to scrambled objects. Object selectivity distinguishes human lateral occipital cortex (LO) from earlier visual areas. Recent studies suggest that, in addition to being object selective, LO is retinotopically organized; LO represents both object and location information. Although LO responses to objects have been shown to depend on location, it is not known whether responses to scrambled objects vary similarly. This is important because it would suggest that the degree of object selectivity in LO does not vary with retinal stimulus position. We used a conventional functional localizer to identify human visual area LO by comparing BOLD responses to objects versus scrambled objects presented to either the upper (UVF) or lower (LVF) visual field. In agreement with recent findings, we found evidence of position-dependent responses to objects. However, we observed the same degree of position dependence for scrambled objects and thus object selectivity did not differ for UVF and LVF stimuli. We conclude that, in terms of BOLD response, LO discriminates objects from non-objects equally well in either visual field location, despite stronger responses to objects in the LVF.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Perceptual closure is the ability to identify objects based on partial information and depends on the function of a distributed network of brain regions that include the dorsal and the ventral visual streams, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate network-level interactions during perceptual closure in schizophrenia using parallel event-related potential (ERP), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and neuropsychological assessment. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient facilities associated with the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research. Patients Twenty-seven patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 23 healthy controls. Intervention Event-related potentials were obtained from 24 patients and 20 healthy volunteers in response to fragmented (closeable) and control-scrambled (noncloseable) line drawings. Functional MRI was performed in 11 patients and 12 controls. Main Outcome Measure Patterns of between-group differences for predefined ERP components and fMRI regions of interest were determined using both analysis of variance and structural equation modeling. Global neuropsychological performance was assessed using standard neuropsychological batteries. RESULTS: Patients showed impaired generation of event-related components reflecting early sensory and later closure-related activity. In fMRI, patients showed impaired activation of the dorsal and ventral visual regions, PFC, and hippocampus. Impaired activation of dorsal stream visual regions contributed significantly to impaired PFC activation, which contributed significantly to impaired activation of the hippocampus and ventral visual stream. Impaired ventral stream and hippocampal activation contributed significantly to deficits on neuropsychological measures of perceptual organization. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia is associated with severe activation deficits across a distributed network of sensory and higher order cognitive regions. Deficit in early visual processing within the dorsal visual stream contributes significantly to impaired frontal activation, which, in turn, leads to dysregulation of the hippocampus and ventral visual stream. Dysfunction within this network underlies deficits in more traditional neurocognitive measures, supporting distributed models of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Abstract: Patients with extinction show a characteristic impairment in the identification of objects when two items are presented simultaneously, typically reporting the ipsilesional item only. The effect is thought to be due to a spatial bias advantaging the ipsilesional item under conditions of competing concurrent stimulation. Action relations between objects can result in recovery from extinction as the object pair may be perceived as a single group rather than competing perceptual units. However, objects interacting together can also have implied motion. Here we test whether implied motion is necessary to generate recovery from extinction. We varied orthogonally whether animate and inanimate objects were paired together in positions related or unrelated to action. Implied motion was greater when an animate object was present than when both stimuli were inanimate. Despite this, recovery from extinction was greater when actions were shown between inanimate objects. We suggest that actions between inanimate objects are perceived more easily due to the surfaces of these stimuli being designed for functional goals (e.g., the flat surface of a hammer head is designed to hit the flattened head of a nail). Attention is sensitive to the fit between potential action and the functional properties of objects, and not just to implied motion between stimuli.

Abstract: While it has been established that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is critical for successful memory formation, the precise contribution of one of the key MTL subregions, the perirhinal cortex (PrC), has been the subject of intense focus and debate. Although this region has been implicated in nonassociative item encoding, recent neuroimaging data have revealed that it also contributes to the binding of specific item-related associations (e.g., an object-color association). Based on neuropsychological evidence that associative memory for unitized word pairs does not require the hippocampus, it has been proposed that PrC contributes to associative memory formation by means of unitization. However, the role of PrC in unitization processes remains unclear. Here, we used fMRI to assess the involvement of PrC in object unitization as well as in successful episodic encoding of item-related details. Our results show that while PrC activation linearly tracks the amount of item-related information successfully encoded, it is not modulated by object unitization demands. Instead, the present data reveal that unitization of object fragments may be accomplished in visual/ventral temporal processing stages before PrC. Indeed, we observed a gradual transition from unitization to successful memory formation across the ventral visual pathway. This suggests that PrC may specifically serve to encode item-related event details, whereas their perceptual integration is established along preceding processing stages.

Abstract: Perception entails interactions between activated brain visual areas and the records of previous sensations, allowing for processes like figure-ground segregation and object recognition. The aim of this study was to characterize top-down effects that originate in the visual cortex and that are involved in the generation and perception of form. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, where subjects viewed 3 groups of stimuli comprising oriented lines with different levels of recognizable high-order structure (none, collinearity, and meaning). Our results showed that recognizable stimuli cause larger activations in anterior visual and frontal areas. In contrast, when stimuli are random or unrecognizable, activations are greater in posterior visual areas, following a hierarchical organization where areas V1/V2 were less active with "collinearity" and the middle occipital cortex was less active with "meaning." An effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling showed that high-order visual form engages higher visual areas that generate top-down signals, from multiple levels of the visual hierarchy. These results are consistent with a model in which if a stimulus has recognizable attributes, such as collinearity and meaning, the areas specialized for processing these attributes send top-down messages to the lower levels to facilitate more efficient encoding of visual form.

Abstract: Regions of the occipital and temporal lobes, including a region in the fusiform gyrus (FG), have been proposed to constitute a "core" visual representation system for faces, in part because they show face selectivity and face repetition suppression. But recent fMRI studies of developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) raise questions about whether these measures relate to face processing skills. Although DPs manifest deficient face processing, most studies to date have not shown unequivocal reductions of functional responses in the proposed core regions. We scanned 15 DPs and 15 non-DP control participants with fMRI while employing factor analysis to derive behavioral components related to face identification or other processes. Repetition suppression specific to facial identities in FG or to expression in FG and STS did not show compelling relationships with face identification ability. However, we identified robust relationships between face selectivity and face identification ability in FG across our sample for several convergent measures, including voxel-wise statistical parametric mapping, peak face selectivity in individually defined "fusiform face areas" (FFAs), and anatomical extents (cluster sizes) of those FFAs. None of these measures showed associations with behavioral expression or object recognition ability. As a group, DPs had reduced face-selective responses in bilateral FFA when compared with non-DPs. Individual DPs were also more likely than non-DPs to lack expected face-selective activity in core regions. These findings associate individual differences in face processing ability with selectivity in core face processing regions. This confirms that face selectivity can provide a valid marker for neural mechanisms that contribute to face identification ability.

Abstract: OBJECT: Schwannomas occupying the craniocervical junction (CCJ) are rare and usually originate from the jugular foramen, hypoglossal nerves, and C-1 and C-2 nerves. Although they may have different origins, they may share the same symptoms, surgical approaches, and complications. An extension of these lesions along the posterior fossa cisterns, foramina, and spinal canal--usually involving various cranial nerves (CNs) and the vertebral and cerebellar arteries--poses a surgical challenge. The primary goals of both surgical and radiosurgical management of schwannomas in the CCJ are the preservation and restoration of function of the lower CNs, and of hearing and facial nerve function. The origins of schwannomas in the CCJ and their clinical presentation, surgical management, adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery, and outcomes in 36 patients treated at Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) are presented. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2009, 36 patients (mean age 43.6 years, range 17-68 years) with craniocervical schwannomas underwent surgical resection at BNI. The records were reviewed retrospectively regarding clinical presentation, radiographic assessment, surgical approaches, adjuvant therapies, and follow-up outcomes. RESULTS: Headache or neck pain was present in 72.2% of patients. Cranial nerve impairments, mainly involving the vagus nerve, were present in 14 patients (38.9%). Motor deficits were found in 27.8% of the patients. Sixteen tumors were intra- and extradural, 15 were intradural, and 5 were extradural. Gross-total resection was achieved in 25 patients (69.4%). Adjunctive radiosurgery was used in the management of residual tumor in 8 patients; tumor control was ultimately obtained in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical removal, which is the treatment of choice, is curative when schwannomas in the CCJ are excised completely. The far-lateral approach and its variations are our preferred approaches for managing these lesions. Most common complications involve deficits of the lower CNs, and their early recognition and rehabilitation are needed. Stereotactic radiosurgery, an important tool for the management of these tumors as adjuvant therapy, can help decrease morbidity rates.

Abstract: To examine the developmental trajectory of object recognition memory and its neural substrate, 10-12-d-old monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received sham operations or neurotoxic hippocampal lesions and were tested at the ages of 1.5, 6, and 18 months on the visual paired-comparison task using delays of 10, 30, 60, and 120 s. In sham-operated controls, incidental recognition memory was present at 1.5 months, became more robust at 6 months, and was delay-dependent by 18 months of age, suggesting that the brain structures mediating these early developing recognition abilities may undergo significant modifications after 6 months of age in monkeys. A similar developmental progression was also observed in animals with neonatal hippocampal lesions, although the delay-dependent effect at 18 months was significantly more pronounced after the neonatal hippocampal lesions, suggesting that with maturation animals with neonatal hippocampal lesions grow into a recognition-memory deficit. These findings suggest not only that the medial temporal cortical areas, known to mediate incidental recognition memory processes in adulthood, could support these processes in early infancy even when long delays are used, but also that later in development, after reaching functional maturity, the hippocampus begins to interact with the medial temporal cortical areas to mediate this function.

Abstract: Although it is well documented that the ability to perceive biological motion is mediated by the lateral temporal cortex, whether and when neural activity in this brain region is modulated by attention is unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether the processing of biological motion requires attention or whether such stimuli are processed preattentively. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging, high-density electroencephalography, and cortically constrained source estimation methods to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of attention on the processing of biological motion. Directing attention to tool motion in overlapping movies of biological motion and tool motion suppressed the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response of the right superior temporal sulcus (STS)/middle temporal gyrus (MTG), while directing attention to biological motion suppressed the BOLD response of the left inferior temporal sulcus (ITS)/MTG. Similarly, category-based modulation of the cortical current source density estimates from the right STS/MTG and left ITS was observed beginning at approximately 450 ms following stimulus onset. Our results indicate that the cortical processing of biological motion is strongly modulated by attention. These findings argue against preattentive processing of biological motion in the presence of stimuli that compete for attention. Our findings also suggest that the attention-based segregation of motion category-specific responses only emerges relatively late (several hundred milliseconds) in processing.

Abstract: Patients with parieto-occipital brain damage may show simultanagnosia, a selective impairment in the simultaneous perception and integration of multiple objects (global perception) with normal recognition of individual objects. Recent findings in patients with simultanagnosia indicate improved global perception at smaller spatial distances between local elements of hierarchical organized complex visual arrays. Global perception thus does not appear to be an all-or-nothing phenomenon but can be modified by the spatial relationship between local elements. The present study aimed to define characteristics of a general principle that accounts for improved global perception of hierarchically organized complex visual arrays in patients with simultanagnosia with respect to the spatial properties of local elements. In detail, we investigated the role of the number and size of the local elements as well as their relationship with each other for the global perception. The findings indicate that global perception increases independently of the size of the global object and depends on the spatial relationship between the local elements and the global object. The results further argue against the possibility of a restriction in the attended or perceived area in simultanagnosia, in the sense that the integration of local elements into a global scene is impaired if a certain spatial "field of view" is exceeded. A possible explanation for these observations might be a shift from global to local saliency in simultanagnosia.

Abstract: The processing of visual and haptic inputs, occurring either separately or jointly, is crucial for everyday-life object recognition, and has been a focus of recent neuroimaging research. Previously, visuohaptic convergence has been mostly investigated with matching-task paradigms. However, much less is known about visuohaptic convergence in the absence of additional task demands. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in which subjects actively touched and/or viewed unfamiliar object stimuli without any additional task demands. In addition, we performed two control experiments with audiovisual and audiohaptic stimulation to examine the specificity of the observed visuohaptic convergence effects. We found robust visuohaptic convergence in bilateral lateral occipital cortex and anterior cerebellum. In contrast, neither the anterior cerebellum nor the lateral occipital cortex showed any involvement in audiovisual or audiohaptic convergence, indicating that multisensory convergence in these regions is specifically geared to visual and haptic inputs. These data suggest that in humans the lateral occipital cortex and the anterior cerebellum play an important role in visuohaptic processing even in the absence of additional task demands.

Abstract: A popular method for investigating whether stimulus information is present in fMRI response patterns is to attempt to "decode" the stimuli from the response patterns with a multivariate classifier. The sensitivity for detecting the information depends on the particular classifier used. However, little is known about the relative performance of different classifiers on fMRI data. Here we compared six multivariate classifiers and investigated how the response-amplitude estimate used (beta- or t-value) and different pattern normalizations affect classification performance. The compared classifiers were a pattern-correlation classifier, a k-nearest-neighbors classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant, Gaussian naive Bayes, and linear and nonlinear (radial-basis-function kernel) support vector machines. We compared these classifiers' accuracy at decoding the category of visual objects from response patterns in human early visual and inferior temporal cortex acquired in an event-related design with BOLD fMRI at 3T using SENSE and isotropic voxels of about 2-mm width. Overall, Fisher's linear discriminant (with an optimal-shrinkage covariance estimator) and the linear support vector machine performed best. The pattern-correlation classifier often performed similarly as those two classifiers. The nonlinear classifiers never performed better and sometimes significantly worse than the linear classifiers, suggesting overfitting. Defining response patterns by t-values (or in error-standard-deviation units) rather than by beta estimates (in % signal change) to define the patterns appeared advantageous. Cross-validation by a leave-one-stimulus-pair-out method gave higher accuracies than a leave-one-run-out method, suggesting that generalization to independent runs (which more safely ensures independence of the test set) is more challenging than generalization to novel stimuli within the same category. Independent selection of fewer more visually responsive voxels tended to yield better decoding performance for all classifiers. Normalizing mean and standard deviation of the response patterns either across stimuli or across voxels had no significant effect on decoding performance. Overall our results suggest that linear decoders based on t-value patterns may perform best in the present scenario of visual object representations measured for about 60min per subject with 3T fMRI.

Abstract: Previous work has implicated prefrontal cortices in selecting among and retrieving conceptual information stored elsewhere. However, recent neurophysiological work in monkeys suggests that prefrontal cortex may play a more direct role in representing conceptual information in a flexible context-specific manner. Here, we investigate the nature of visual object representations from perceptual to conceptual levels in an unbiased data-driven manner using a functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm with pictures of animals. Throughout much of occipital cortex, activity was highly sensitive to changes in 2D stimulus form, consistent with tuning to form and position within retinotopic coordinates and matching an automated measure of shape similarity. Broad superordinate conceptual information was represented as early as extrastriate and posterior ventral temporal cortex. These regions were not completely invariant to form, suggesting that form similarity remains an important organizational constraint into the temporal cortex. Separate sites within prefrontal cortex represented broad and narrow conceptual tuning, with more anterior sites tuned narrowly to close conceptual associates in a manner that was invariant to stimulus form/position and that matched independent similarity ratings of the stimuli. The combination of broad and narrow conceptual tuning within prefrontal cortex may support flexible selection, retrieval, and classification of objects at different levels of categorical abstraction.

Abstract: Perceptual closure refers to the coherent perception of an object under circumstances when the visual information is incomplete. Although the perceptual closure index observed in electroencephalography reflects that an object has been recognized, the full spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical source activity underlying perceptual closure processing remain unknown so far. To address this question, we recorded magnetoencephalographic activity in 15 subjects (11 females) during a visual closure task and performed beamforming over a sequence of successive short time windows to localize high-frequency gamma-band activity (60-100 Hz). Two-tone images of human faces (Mooney faces) were used to examine perceptual closure. Event-related fields exhibited a magnetic closure index between 250 and 325 ms. Time-frequency analyses revealed sustained high-frequency gamma-band activity associated with the processing of Mooney stimuli; closure-related gamma-band activity was observed between 200 and 300 ms over occipitotemporal channels. Time-resolved source reconstruction revealed an early (0-200 ms) coactivation of caudal inferior temporal gyrus (cITG) and regions in posterior parietal cortex (PPC). At the time of perceptual closure (200-400 ms), the activation in cITG extended to the fusiform gyrus, if a face was perceived. Our data provide the first electrophysiological evidence that perceptual closure for Mooney faces starts with an interaction between areas related to processing of three-dimensional structure from shading cues (cITG) and areas associated with the activation of long-term memory templates (PPC). Later, at the moment of perceptual closure, inferior temporal cortex areas specialized for the perceived object are activated, i.e., the fusiform gyrus related to face processing for Mooney stimuli.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Studies of developmental deficits in face recognition, or developmental prosopagnosia, have shown that individuals who have not suffered brain damage can show face recognition impairments coupled with normal object recognition (Duchaine and Nakayama, 2005; Duchaine et al., 2006; Nunn et al., 2001). However, no developmental cases with the opposite dissociation - normal face recognition with impaired object recognition - have been reported. The existence of a case of non-face developmental visual agnosia would indicate that the development of normal face recognition mechanisms does not rely on the development of normal object recognition mechanisms. METHODS: To see whether a developmental variant of non-face visual object agnosia exists, we conducted a series of web-based object and face recognition tests to screen for individuals showing object recognition memory impairments but not face recognition impairments. Through this screening process, we identified AW, an otherwise normal 19-year-old female, who was then tested in the lab on face and object recognition tests. RESULTS: AW's performance was impaired in within-class visual recognition memory across six different visual categories (guns, horses, scenes, tools, doors, and cars). In contrast, she scored normally on seven tests of face recognition, tests of memory for two other object categories (houses and glasses), and tests of recall memory for visual shapes. Testing confirmed that her impairment was not related to a general deficit in lower-level perception, object perception, basic-level recognition, or memory. DISCUSSION: AW's results provide the first neuropsychological evidence that recognition memory for non-face visual object categories can be selectively impaired in individuals without brain damage or other memory impairment. These results indicate that the development of recognition memory for faces does not depend on intact object recognition memory and provide further evidence for category-specific dissociations in visual recognition.

Abstract: Observers spontaneously segment larger activities into smaller events. For example, "washing a car" might be segmented into "scrubbing," "rinsing," and "drying" the car. This process, called event segmentation, separates "what is happening now? from "what just happened." In this study, we show that event segmentation predicts activity in the hippocampus when people access recent information. Participants watched narrative film and occasionally attempted to retrieve from memory objects that recently appeared in the film. The delay between object presentation and test was always 5 sec. Critically, for some of the objects, the event changed during the delay whereas for others the event continued. Using fMRI, we examined whether retrieval-related brain activity differed when the event changed during the delay. Brain regions involved in remembering past experiences over long periods, including the hippocampus, were more active during retrieval when the event changed during the delay. Thus, the way an object encountered just 5 sec ago is retrieved from memory appears to depend in part on what happened in those 5 sec. These data strongly suggest that the segmentation of ongoing activity into events is a control process that regulates when memory for events is updated.

Abstract: OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to evaluate the unique presenting signs and symptoms of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) in children younger than 6 years of age and highlight the benefits of early surgical treatment in this patient population. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who presented to the neurosurgery department before their 6th birthday and subsequently underwent surgery for CM-I. They identified 39 patients who had been evaluated between 1984 and 2007 and examined the medical records for presentation, surgical intervention, and outcome. RESULTS: Children aged 0-2 years commonly presented with oropharyngeal dysfunction (77.8%). Children aged 3-5 years more frequently presented with syringomyelia (85.7%), scoliosis (38.1%), and/or headache (57.1%). All patients underwent posterior fossa craniectomy. Additionally, in many patients cervical laminectomy and/or duraplasty was performed. A few patients required transoral decompression and occipitocervical fusion. In most cases, surgery led to resolution or dramatic improvement of initial symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and surgical treatment of CM-I in young children leads to good outcomes in the majority of patients. Additional therapies for oropharyngeal dysfunction, syringomyelia, and scoliosis can frequently be avoided.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has identified face- and body part-selective regions, as well as distributed activation patterns for object categories across human ventral temporal cortex (VTC), eliciting a debate regarding functional organization in VTC and neural coding of object categories. Using high-resolution fMRI, we illustrate that face- and limb-selective activations alternate in a series of largely nonoverlapping clusters in lateral VTC along the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), fusiform gyrus (FG), and occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS). Both general linear model (GLM) and multivoxel pattern (MVP) analyses show that face- and limb-selective activations minimally overlap and that this organization is consistent across experiments and days. We provide a reliable method to separate two face-selective clusters on the middle and posterior FG (mFus and pFus), and another on the IOG using their spatial relation to limb-selective activations and retinotopic areas hV4, VO-1/2, and hMT+. Furthermore, these activations show a gradient of increasing face selectivity and decreasing limb selectivity from the IOG to the mFus. Finally, MVP analyses indicate that there is differential information for faces in lateral VTC (containing weakly- and highly-selective voxels) relative to non-selective voxels in medial VTC. These findings suggest a sparsely-distributed organization where sparseness refers to the presence of several face- and limb-selective clusters in VTC, and distributed refers to the presence of different amounts of information in highly-, weakly-, and non-selective voxels. Consequently, theories of object recognition should consider the functional and spatial constraints of neural coding across a series of minimally overlapping category-selective clusters that are themselves distributed.

Abstract: Chinese people engage long-term processing of characters. It has been demonstrated that the presented orientation affects the perception of several types of stimuli when people have possessed expertise with them, e.g. face, body, and scene. However, the influence of inversion on the neural mechanism of Chinese character processing has not been sufficiently discussed. In the present study, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment is performed to examine the effect of inversion on Chinese character processing, which employs Chinese character, face and house as stimuli. The region of interest analysis demonstrates inversion leads to neural response increases for Chinese character in left fusiform character-preferential area, bilateral fusiform object-preferential area and bilateral occipital object-preferential area, and such inversion-caused changes in the response pattern of characters processing are highly similar to those of faces processing but quiet different from those of houses processing. Whole brain analysis reveals the upright characters recruit several language regions for phonology and semantic processing, however, the inverted characters activated extensive regions related to the visual information processing. Our findings reveal a shift from the character-preferential processing route to the generic object processing steam within visual cortex when the characters are inverted, and suggest that different mechanisms may underlie the upright and the inverted Chinese character, respectively.

Abstract: Registration of pre- and intra-interventional data is one of the key technologies for image-guided radiation therapy, radiosurgery, minimally invasive surgery, endoscopy, and interventional radiology. In this paper, we survey those 3D/2D data registration methods that utilize 3D computer tomography or magnetic resonance images as the pre-interventional data and 2D X-ray projection images as the intra-interventional data. The 3D/2D registration methods are reviewed with respect to image modality, image dimensionality, registration basis, geometric transformation, user interaction, optimization procedure, subject, and object of registration.

Abstract: Two experiments are reported that use patients with visual extinction to examine how visual attention is influenced by action information in images. In Experiment 1 patients saw images of objects that were either correctly or incorrectly colocated for action, with the objects held by hands that were congruent or incongruent with those used premorbidly by the patients. The images were also shown from a 1st- and 3rd-person perspective. There was an overall reduction in extinction for objects colocated for action. In addition, there was an extra benefit when the objects were held in hands congruent with those used by the patients and when the objects were seen from a 1st-person perspective. This last result fits with an effect of motor simulation, over and above a purely visual effect based on positioning objects correctly for action. Experiment 2 showed that effects of hand congruence could emerge with images depicted from a 3rd-person perspective when patients saw themselves holding the objects. The data indicate 2 effects of action information on extinction: (a) an effect of colocating objects for action, which does not depend on a self-reference frame (a visual effect), and (b) an effect sensitive to object-hand congruence, which does depend on a self-reference frame (a motor-based effect). The self-reference frame is induced when stimuli are viewed from a 1st-person perspective and when an image of the self is seen from a 3rd-person perspective. Both visual and motor-based effects of action information facilitate the spread of attention across objects.

Abstract: Humans freely interpret moving shapes as being "alive" and having social intentions, such as beliefs and desires. The brain systems underpinning these processes are the same as those used to detect animacy and infer mental states from human behaviour. However, it is not yet known if the brain systems that respond to human action-goals also respond to the action-goals of shapes. In the present paper, we used a repetition suppression paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain systems that respond to the action-goals of shapes. Participants watched video clips of simple, geometrical shapes performing different 'take-object' goals. Repeated presentation of the same goal suppressed the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), a brain region known to distinguish the goals of human hand actions. This finding shows that left aIPS shows similar sensitivity to the action-goals of human and non-human agents. Our data complement previous work on animacy perception and mental state inference, which suggest components of the social brain are driven by the type of action comprehension that is engaged rather than by the form of the acting agent (i.e., human or shape). Further, the results have consequence for theories of goal understanding in situations without access to biological form or motion.

Abstract: OBJECT: The authors describe their experience with functional MR (fMR) imaging in children as young as 5 years of age, or even younger in developmental age equivalent. Functional MR imaging can be useful for identifying eloquent cortex prior to surgical intervention. Most fMR imaging clinical work has been done in adults, and although children as young as 8 years of age have been included in larger clinical series, cases in younger children are rarely reported. METHODS: The authors reviewed presurgical fMR images in eight patients who were 8 years of age or younger, six of whom were 5 or 6 years of age. Each patient had undergone neuropsychological testing. Three patients functioned at a below-average level, with adaptive functioning age scores of 3 to 4 years. Self-paced finger tapping (with passive movement in one patient) and silent language tasks were used as activation tasks. The language task was modified for younger children, for whom the same (not novel) stimuli were used for extensive practice ahead of time and in the MR imaging unit. Patient preparation involved techniques such as having experienced staff present to work with patients and providing external management during imaging. Six of eight patients had extensive training and practice prior to the procedure. In the two youngest patients, this training included use of a mock MR unit. RESULTS: All cases yielded successful imaging. Finger tapping in all seven of the patients who could perform it demonstrated focal motor activation in the frontal-parietal region, with expected activation elsewhere, including in the cerebellum. Three of four patients had the expected verb generation task activations, with left-hemisphere dominance, including a 6-year-old child who functioned at the 3-year, 9-month level. The only child (an 8-year-old) who was not prepared prior to the imaging session for the verb generation task failed this task due to movement artifact. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges of successfully using fMR imaging in very young and clinically involved patients, these studies can be performed successfully in children with a chronological age of 5 or 6 years and a developmental age as young as 3 or 4 years.

Abstract: We report the results of an fMRI investigation of the neural bases of written language comprehension (reading) and production (spelling). Both tasks were examined in the same individuals, allowing greater precision in establishing the relationship between the neural underpinnings of these two cognitive functions. Also examined was the relationship between written language substrates and those involved in face and object (house) processing. The results reveal that reading and spelling share specific left hemisphere substrates in the mid-fusiform gyrus and in the inferior frontal gyrus/junction. Furthermore, the results indicate that the left mid-fusiform substrates are specifically involved in lexical orthographic processing. We also find that written language and face processing exhibit largely complementary activation patterns in both the fusiform and the inferior frontal/junction areas, with left and right lateralization, respectively. In sum, these results provide perhaps the strongest evidence to date of components that are shared by written language comprehension (reading) and production (spelling), and they further our understanding of the role of literacy within the larger repertoire of cognitive operations and their neural substrates.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Recent studies show evidence of multisensory representation in the functionally normal visual cortex, but this idea remains controversial. Occipital cortex activation is often claimed to be a reflection of mental visual imagery processes triggered by other modalities. However, if the occipital cortex is genuinely active during touch, this might be the basis for the massive cross-modal plasticity observed in the congenitally blind. METHODS: To address these issues, we used fMRI to compare patterns of activation evoked by a tactile object recognition (TOR) task (right or left hand) in 8 sighted and 8 congenitally blind subjects, with several other control tasks. RESULTS: TOR robustly activated object selective regions in the lateral occipital complex (LOC/LOtv) in the blind (similar to the patterns of activation found in the sighted), indicating that object identification per se (i.e. in the absence of visual imagery) is sufficient to evoke responses in the LOC/LOtv. Importantly, there was negligible occipital activation for hand movements (imitating object palpations) in the occipital cortex, in both groups. Moreover, in both groups, TOR activation in the LOC/LOtv was bilateral, regardless of the palpating hand (similar to the lack of strong visual field preference in the LOC/LOtv for viewed objects). Finally, the most prominent enhancement in TOR activation in the congenitally blind (compared to their sighted peers) was found in the posterior occipital cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that visual imagery is not an obligatory condition for object activation in visual cortex. It also demonstrates the massive plasticity in visual cortex of the blind for tactile object recognition that involves both the ventral and dorsal occipital areas, probably to support the high demand for this function in the blind.

Abstract: Objects along a route can serve as crucial landmarks that facilitate successful navigation. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence indicated that the human parahippocampal gyrus automatically distinguishes between objects placed at navigationally relevant (decision points) and irrelevant locations (non-decision points). This storage of relevant objects can provide a neural mechanism underlying successful navigation. However, only objects that actually support wayfinding need to be stored. Objects can also provide misleading information if similar objects appear at different locations along a route. An efficient mechanism needs to specifically adjust for ambiguous landmark information. We investigated this by placing identical objects twice in a virtual labyrinth at places with the same as well as with a different navigational relevance. Twenty right-handed volunteers moved through a virtual maze. They viewed the same object either at two different decision points, at two different non-decision points, or at a decision as well as at a non-decision point. Afterwards, event-related fMRI data were acquired during object recognition. Participants decided whether they had seen the objects in the maze or not. The results showed that activity in the parahippocampal gyrus was increased for objects placed at a decision and at a non-decision point as compared to objects placed at two non-decision points. However, ambiguous information resulting from the same object placed at two different decision points revealed increased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus. These findings suggest a neural wayfinding mechanism that differentiates between helpful and misleading information.

Abstract: Backbone anatomical structure detection and labeling is a necessary step for various analysis tasks of the vertebral column. Appearance, shape and geometry measurements are necessary for abnormality detection locally at each disc and vertebrae (such as herniation) as well as globally for the whole spine (such as spinal scoliosis). We propose a two-level probabilistic model for the localization of discs from clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data that captures both pixel- and object-level features. Using a Gibbs distribution, we model appearance and spatial information at the pixel level, and at the object level, we model the spatial distribution of the discs and the relative distances between them. We use generalized expectation-maximization for optimization, which achieves efficient convergence of disc labels. Our two-level model allows the assumption of conditional independence at the pixel-level to enhance efficiency while maintaining robustness. We use a dataset that contains 105 MRI clinical normal and abnormal cases for the lumbar area. We thoroughly test our model and achieve encouraging results on normal and abnormal cases.

Abstract: Repeating object images produces stimulus-specific repetition suppression referred to as functional magnetic resonance imaging-adaptation (fMRI-A) in ventral temporal cortex (VTC). However, the effects of stimulus repetition on functional selectivity are largely unknown. We investigated the effects of short-lagged (SL, immediate) and long-lagged (LL, many intervening stimuli) repetitions on category selectivity in VTC using high-resolution fMRI. We asked whether repetition produces scaling or sharpening of fMRI responses both within category-selective regions as well as in the distributed response pattern across VTC. Results illustrate that repetition effects across time scales vary quantitatively along an anterior-posterior axis and qualitatively along a lateral-medial axis. In lateral VTC, both SL and LL repetitions produce proportional fMRI-A with no change in either selectivity or distributed responses as predicted by a scaling model. Further, there is larger fMRI-A in anterior subregions irrespective of category selectivity. Medial VTC exhibits similar scaling effects during SL repetitions. However, for LL repetitions, both the selectivity and distributed pattern of responses vary with category in medial VTC as predicted by a sharpening model. Specifically, there is larger fMRI-A for nonpreferred categories compared with the preferred category, and category selectivity does not predict fMRI-A across the pattern of distributed response. Finally, simulations indicate that different neural mechanisms likely underlie fMRI-A in medial compared to lateral VTC. These results have important implications for future fMRI-A experiments because they suggest that fMRI-A does not reflect a universal neural mechanism and that results of fMRI-A experiments will likely be paradigm independent in lateral VTC but paradigm dependent in medial VTC.

Abstract: An intriguing region of human visual cortex (the fusiform face area; FFA) responds selectively to faces as a general higher-order stimulus category. However, the potential role of lower-order stimulus properties in FFA remains incompletely understood. To clarify those lower-level influences, we measured FFA responses to independent variation in 4 lower-level stimulus dimensions using standardized face stimuli and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). These dimensions were size, position, contrast, and rotation in depth (viewpoint). We found that FFA responses were strongly influenced by variations in each of these image dimensions; that is, FFA responses were not "invariant" to any of them. Moreover, all FFA response functions were highly correlated with V1 responses (r = 0.95-0.99). As in V1, FFA responses could be accurately modeled as a combination of responses to 1) local contrast plus 2) the cortical magnification factor. In some measurements (e.g., face size or a combinations of multiple cues), the lower-level variations dominated the range of FFA responses. Manipulation of lower-level stimulus parameters could even change the category preference of FFA from "face selective" to "object selective." Altogether, these results emphasize that a significant portion of the FFA response reflects lower-level visual responses.

Abstract: We present a patient, who, following a right posterior ischemia, showed a selective deficit in visually recognising pictures, objects and faces. She was able to read and comprehend any kind of written material and could recognise letters and numbers. Her inability to recognise pictures did not arise from a deficit at the structural description level and/or from a poor semantic knowledge of the stimuli. We argue that her recognition deficit arose from an inability in combining the different elements of the visual stimuli in an unitary percept. Results are discussed in terms of dissociations between local versus global processing, as well as bottom-up versus top-down mechanisms.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to shed light on the nature of the imagery deficits in two patients with representational neglect and to determine whether representational neglect is affected by the content of the mental images the patients have to generate, inspect and manipulate. In particular, we submitted two patients with different types of representational neglect to a battery of visual mental imagery tests to assess the different kinds of imagery processes. We found that Patient 1, whose performance was asymmetrical on the O'Clock Test, performed poorly on tasks involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of objects but showed no deficit on tasks involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of environments. On the other hand, Patient 2, whose performance was asymmetrical on the Familiar Squares Description Test, performed poorly on tasks involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of environments, but not on tasks involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of objects. Our results demonstrate that environments and objects in the imagery domain can be represented separately and can be selectively affected by damage following brain lesions.

Abstract: The human visual system must perform complex visuospatial extrapolations (VSE) across space and time in order to extract shape and form from the retinal projection of a cluttered visual environment characterized by occluded surfaces and moving objects. Even if we exclude the temporal dimension, for instance when judging whether an extended finger is pointing towards one object or another, the mechanisms of VSE remain opaque. Here we investigated the neural correlates of VSE using functional magnetic resonance imaging in sixteen human observers while they judged the relative position of, or saccaded to, a (virtual) target defined by the extrapolated path of a pointer. Using whole brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses, we compared the brain activity evoked by these VSE tasks to similar control judgements or eye movements made to explicit (dot) targets that did not require extrapolation. The data show that activity in an occipitotemporal region that included the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) was significantly greater during VSE than during control tasks. A similar, though less pronounced, pattern was also evident in regions of the fronto-parietal cortex that included the frontal eye fields. However, none of the ROIs examined exhibited a significant interaction between target type (extrapolated/explicit) and response type (oculomotor/perceptual). These findings are consistent with a close association between visuoperceptual and oculomotor responses, and highlight a critical role for the LOC in the process of VSE.

Abstract: Under conditions of visual fixation, perceptual fading occurs when a stationary object, though present in the world and continually casting light upon the retina, vanishes from visual consciousness. The neural correlates of the consciousness of such an object will presumably modulate in activity with the onset and cessation of perceptual fading. METHOD: In order to localize the neural correlates of perceptual fading, a green disk that had been individually set to be equiluminant with the orange background, was presented in one of the four visual quadrants; Subjects indicated with a button press whether or not the disk was subjectively visible as it perceptually faded in and out. RESULTS: Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in V1 and ventral retinotopic areas V2v and V3v decreases when the disk subjectively disappears, and increases when it subjectively reappears. This effect occurs in early visual areas both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the fading figure. That is, it occurs regardless of whether the fading stimulus is presented inside or outside of the corresponding portion of visual field. In addition, we find that the microsaccade rate rises before and after perceptual transitions from not seeing to seeing the disk, and decreases before perceptual transitions from seeing to not seeing the disk. These BOLD signal changes could be driven by a global process that operates across contralateral and ipsilateral visual cortex or by a confounding factor, such as microsaccade rate.

Abstract: Previous literature suggest that processing of visually presented shapes and textures starts in the early visual areas, but subsequently follow different pathways. The purpose of this experiment was to further investigate differential activation for shapes and textures in order elucidate the pathways involved in visual shape and texture matching. In the present study, brain areas involved in discrimination of shapes and textures are mapped, using the same set of stimuli for shape and texture decisions. Texture matching activates more prefrontal regions than shape matching, particularly regions in the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Shape specific activation includes an occipital/temporal region which is associated with multimodal object matching. The pattern of results suggests that recognition of textures may be based upon different ordering conditions in memory, which involve a prefrontal network and require a great deal more workload than the holistic representation of shape.

Abstract: To the naive observer, cubist paintings contain geometrical forms in which familiar objects are hardly recognizable, even in the presence of a meaningful title. We used fMRI to test whether a short training session about Cubism would facilitate object recognition in paintings by Picasso, Braque and Gris. Subjects, who had no formal art education, were presented with titled or untitled cubist paintings and scrambled images, and performed object recognition tasks. Relative to the control group, trained subjects recognized more objects in the paintings, their response latencies were significantly shorter, and they showed enhanced activation in the parahippocampal cortex, with a parametric increase in the amplitude of the fMRI signal as a function of the number of recognized objects. Moreover, trained subjects were slower to report not recognizing any familiar objects in the paintings and these longer response latencies were correlated with activation in a fronto-parietal network. These findings suggest that trained subjects adopted a visual search strategy and used contextual associations to perform the tasks. Our study supports the proactive brain framework, according to which the brain uses associations to generate predictions.

Abstract: The ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in humans includes functionally defined regions that preferentially respond to objects, faces, and places. Recent developmental studies suggest that the face selective region in the fusiform gyrus ('fusiform face area', FFA) undergoes a prolonged development involving substantial increases in its volume after 7 years of age. However, the endpoint of this development is not known. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the development of face-, object- and place selective regions in the VTC of adolescents (12-16 year olds) and adults (18-40 year olds). We found that the volume of face selective activations in the right fusiform gyrus was substantially larger in adults than in adolescents, and was positively correlated with age. This development was associated with higher response amplitudes and selectivity for faces in face selective regions of VTC and increased differentiation of the distributed response patterns to faces versus non-face stimuli across the entire VTC. Furthermore, right FFA size was positively correlated with face recognition memory performance, but not with recognition memory of objects or places. In contrast, the volume of object- and place selective cortical regions or their response amplitudes did not change across these age groups. Thus, we found a striking and prolonged development of face selectivity across the VTC during adolescence that was specifically associated with proficiency in face recognition memory. These findings have important implications for theories of development and functional specialization in VTC.

Abstract: Information integration across different sensory modalities contributes to object recognition, the generation of associations and long-term memory representations. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation to investigate the presence of sensory integrative effects at cortical levels as early as nonprimary auditory and extrastriate visual cortices, which are implicated in intermediate stages of object processing. Stimulation consisted of an adapting audiovisual stimulus S(1) and a subsequent stimulus S(2) from the same basic-level category (e.g., cat). The stimuli were carefully balanced with respect to stimulus complexity and semantic congruency and presented in four experimental conditions: (1) the same image and vocalization for S(1) and S(2), (2) the same image and a different vocalization, (3) different images and the same vocalization, or (4) different images and vocalizations. This two-by-two factorial design allowed us to assess the contributions of auditory and visual stimulus repetitions and changes in a statistically orthogonal manner. Responses in visual regions of right fusiform gyrus and right lateral occipital cortex were reduced for repeated visual stimuli (repetition suppression). Surprisingly, left lateral occipital cortex showed stronger responses to repeated auditory stimuli (repetition enhancement). Similarly, auditory regions of interest of the right middle superior temporal gyrus and sulcus exhibited repetition suppression to auditory repetitions and repetition enhancement to visual repetitions. Our findings of crossmodal repetition-related effects in cortices of the respective other sensory modality add to the emerging view that in human subjects sensory integrative mechanisms operate on earlier cortical processing levels than previously assumed.

Abstract: Patients with simultanagnosia following bilateral parieto-temporo-occipital brain damage show a characteristic impairment of global gestalt perception, while their perception of individual objects or elements remains intact. For instance, when shown 'hierarchical' stimuli comprising a larger global object (e.g. a large letter) made up from smaller components (e.g. multiple small letters), they typically report seeing one of the smaller components but not the global figure. Recent work on simultanagnosia revealed that global perception can be improved if local element spacing is reduced. However, it is still unclear whether the retinal separation or the physical (post-size-constancy) spatial separation is critical. Here, we presented various hierarchical global/local letter stimuli at different viewing distances and sizes to separate the impacts of retinal versus physical size. Our findings indicate a key role for visual angle in determining simultanagnosic perception. We observed that not only retinal spacing (in terms of visual angle) between local elements had a major impact on global perception in simultanagnosia, but also the physical size of the separation between local elements, provided that binocular cues to viewing distance were available. The results indicate both pre-size-constancy retinal influences and binocular-post-constancy influences upon conscious perception in simultanagnosia.

Abstract: Multisensory interactions have been demonstrated in a distributed neural system encompassing primary sensory and higher-order association areas. However, their distinct functional roles in multisensory integration remain unclear. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study dissociated the functional contributions of three cortical levels to multisensory integration in object categorization. Subjects actively categorized or passively perceived noisy auditory and visual signals emanating from everyday actions with objects. The experiment included two 2 x 2 factorial designs that manipulated either (1) the presence/absence or (2) the informativeness of the sensory inputs. These experimental manipulations revealed three patterns of audiovisual interactions. (1) In primary auditory cortices (PACs), a concurrent visual input increased the stimulus salience by amplifying the auditory response regardless of task-context. Effective connectivity analyses demonstrated that this automatic response amplification is mediated via both direct and indirect [via superior temporal sulcus (STS)] connectivity to visual cortices. (2) In STS and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), audiovisual interactions sustained the integration of higher-order object features and predicted subjects' audiovisual benefits in object categorization. (3) In the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), explicit semantic categorization resulted in suppressive audiovisual interactions as an index for multisensory facilitation of semantic retrieval and response selection. In conclusion, multisensory integration emerges at multiple processing stages within the cortical hierarchy. The distinct profiles of audiovisual interactions dissociate audiovisual salience effects in PACs, formation of object representations in STS/IPS and audiovisual facilitation of semantic categorization in vlPFC. Furthermore, in STS/IPS, the profiles of audiovisual interactions were behaviorally relevant and predicted subjects' multisensory benefits in performance accuracy.

Abstract: Deeper semantic processing of words leads to enhanced memory encoding (depth of processing effect). The left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC) and the left hippocampus are known to be involved in this effect. We tested the hypothesis that different semantic encoding processes contribute qualitatively differently to memory encoding. In a memory experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared three different encoding tasks: a nonsemantic alphabetical, an animacy decision, and a size comparison tasks. Recognition memory was tested subsequently. We hypothesized that the size comparison task would activate brain areas involved in the processing of object features and that this would be associated with successful memory encoding. Results showed that the size comparison task led to significantly better memory encoding than the two other tasks. As with the animacy decision task, it led to stronger activation of the LIPC and left hippocampus than the nonsemantic task. Both regions also had stronger activations for later remembered than for nonremembered words. The size comparison task additionally led to stronger activation in the left anterior fusiform gyrus, which was also associated with successful memory encoding. We conclude that different types of semantic processing affect memory encoding based on distinguishable brain processes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most prior studies on selective attention in the setting of total sleep deprivation (SD) have focused on behavior or activation within fronto-parietal cognitive control areas. Here, we evaluated the effects of SD on the top-down biasing of activation of ventral visual cortex and on functional connectivity between cognitive control and other brain regions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-three healthy young adult volunteers underwent fMRI after a normal night of sleep (RW) and after sleep deprivation in a counterbalanced manner while performing a selective attention task. During this task, pictures of houses or faces were randomly interleaved among scrambled images. Across different blocks, volunteers responded to house but not face pictures, face but not house pictures, or passively viewed pictures without responding. The appearance of task-relevant pictures was unpredictable in this paradigm. SD resulted in less accurate detection of target pictures without affecting the mean false alarm rate or response time. In addition to a reduction of fronto-parietal activation, attending to houses strongly modulated parahippocampal place area (PPA) activation during RW, but this attention-driven biasing of PPA activation was abolished following SD. Additionally, SD resulted in a significant decrement in functional connectivity between the PPA and two cognitive control areas, the left intraparietal sulcus and the left inferior frontal lobe. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SD impairs selective attention as evidenced by reduced selectivity in PPA activation. Further, reduction in fronto-parietal and ventral visual task-related activation suggests that it also affects sustained attention. Reductions in functional connectivity may be an important additional imaging parameter to consider in characterizing the effects of sleep deprivation on cognition.

Abstract: We present a neurocognitive model of long-term object memory. We propose that perceptual priming and episodic recognition are phenomena based on three distinct kinds of representations. We label these representations types and tokens. Types are prototypical representations needed for object identification. The network of non-arbitrary features necessary for object categorization is sharpened in the course of repeated identification, an effect that we call type trace and which causes perceptual priming. Tokens, on the other hand, support episodic recognition. Perirhinal structures are proposed to bind intrinsic within-object features into an object token that can be thought of as a consolidated perceptual object file. Hippocampal structures integrate object- with contextual information in an episodic token. The reinstatement of an object token is assumed to generate a feeling of familiarity, whereas recollection occurs when the reinstatement of an episodic token occurs. Retrieval mode and retrieval orientation dynamically modulate access to these representations. In this review, we apply the model to recent empirical research (behavioral, fMRI, and ERP data) including a series of studies from our own lab. We put specific emphasis on the effects that sensory features and their study-test match have on familiarity. The type-token approach fits the data and additionally provides a framework for the analysis of concepts like unitization and associative reinstatement.

Abstract: Perceptual expertise is traditionally associated with enhanced brain activity in response to objects of expertise in category-selective visual cortex, primarily face-selective regions. We reevaluated this view by investigating whether the brain activity associated with expertise in object recognition is limited to category-selective cortex and specifically whether the extent of expertise-related activity manifests automatically or whether it can be top-down modulated. We conducted 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing changes in hemodynamic activity associated with car expertise in a conventional 1-back task (Experiment 1) and when the task relevance of cars was explicitly manipulated (Experiment 2). Whole-brain analysis unveiled extensive expertise-related activity throughout the visual cortex, starting as early as V1 and extending into nonvisual areas. However, when the cars were task irrelevant, the expertise-related activity drastically diminished, indeed, becoming similar to the activity elicited by cars in novices. We suggest that expertise entails voluntary top-down engagement of multiple neural networks in addition to stimulus-driven activation associated with perceptual mechanisms.

Abstract: Brain imaging methods can visualize the anatomy and activity of children's brains, from the first year of life. These structures and activities are subsequently "recycled" by acquisitions such as reading and arithmetic. Evoked potential mapping of babies aged only a few months, with 64 or 128 electrodes, has a temporal precision of the millisecond order. Magneto-encephalography (MEG) is a costly method. Safe at the field strengths currently used (1.5 or 3 T), MRI requires anti-ferromagnetic precautions, noise protection (tunnel, helmet), and the presence of a parent in the child's field of view. Despite these efforts, movement artifacts remain more of a problem than with adult brain imaging. Brain organization in very young children includes cortical folds and their evolution with time in the premature brain; asymmetry and lateralization of language; the superior temporal sulcus; and anatomical asymmetries combined with early functional organization. The response to spoken language (two-three months), activation of the temporal region and left inferior frontal region (Broca)--as in adults, the asymmetry favoring the left hemisphere during temporal activation (planum). The temporal lobe is hierarchically organized: as in adults, the fastest responses are observed in the primary auditory cortex, decreasing gradually as one progresses to the planum temporal. Syllabes discrimination, regardless of the speaker, and a fusion of visual and auditory information with respect to speech. The newborn brain specializes in the vowels and consonants of the mother tongue, and early visual recognition, especially of faces. Evoked potentials to study the separation of a dorsal track and a classical ventral track in adults. Ventral = identification of objects regardless of their position and orientation; dorsal visual pathway = calculation of the position of objects, action planning, but also counting the number of objects. Evoked potentials at 3 months = brain = already capable of observing changes in the nature and number of a set of objects. We have observed at this early age a clear division between ventral (left temporal) processing of identity and dorsal (right parietal) processing of numbers of objects. The infant brain is already organized during the first months of life. My postulate is that these early cerebral biases provide a framework which constrains cultural learning. Cultural inventions such as reading or symbolic calculation invade the cortical circuits that have evolved in a different context but that can be partly recycled for new human-specific uses. Each cultural object occupies a particular brain niche, a circuit that is already organized but that has sufficient plasticity to be retrained.

Abstract: We tested rapid-categorization in a patient who was impaired in face and object recognition. Photographs of natural scenes were displayed for 100 ms. Participants had to press a key when they saw an animal among various objects as distractors or human faces among animal faces as distractors. Though the patient was impaired at figure/ground segregation, recognized very few objects and faces, she categorized animals and faces with a performance ranging between 70 and 86% correct. Displaying pictures in isolation did not improve performance. The results suggest that rapid categorization can be accomplished on the basis of coarse information without overt recognition.

Abstract: Searching for an object in a complex visual scene involves selection mechanisms. Generally, it is assumed that efficient "pop-out" search involves mainly bottom-up processing, whereas inefficient search requires pronounced top-down control over visual processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in behaving monkeys to explore the functional network involved in efficient visual search. As a pop-out target automatically attracts spatial attention, we attempted to determine the regions involved in feature selection independently of the spatial allocation of attention. Therefore, monkeys were trained to perform a search task in which they had to covertly detect the presence of a salient target among distractor objects. Three tasks were used to control, as much as possible, for the spatial allocation of attention. These control tasks were matched with the search task for visual input and manual responses. Pop-out search, when compared with the control tasks, activated 3 frontal regions: frontal eye field, area 45, and a posterior portion of area 46, in addition to small activation sites in lateral intraparietal area and inferotemporal area TE. Our results show that efficient search involves frontal regions as much as visual regions and in particular that ventral prefrontal area 45 is involved in top-down control during efficient search.

Abstract: The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has been closely linked to limitations of visual short-term memory capacity (VSTM; Todd and Marois 2004; Xu and Chun 2006). It is not clearly known, however, to what extent IPS activation reflects VSTM for object identity (What) versus spatial location (Where) information. The present study was designed to manipulate selectively the amount of What and Where information retained in VSTM in order to determine, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the effect of VSTM for each of these 2 dimensions on IPS activation. The results showed an increase in IPS activation only in response to increasing Where memory load, with no effect of What load suggesting that capacity-related activation in the IPS primarily reflects the amount of spatial information retained in VSTM.

Abstract: Early retinotopic cortex has traditionally been viewed as containing a veridical representation of the low-level properties of the image, not imbued by high-level interpretation and meaning. Yet several recent results indicate that neural representations in early retinotopic cortex reflect not just the sensory properties of the image, but also the perceived size and brightness of image regions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging pattern analyses to ask whether the representation of an object in early retinotopic cortex changes when the object is recognized compared with when the same stimulus is presented but not recognized. Our data confirmed this hypothesis: the pattern of response in early retinotopic visual cortex to a two-tone "Mooney" image of an object was more similar to the response to the full grayscale photo version of the same image when observers knew what the two-tone image represented than when they did not. Further, in a second experiment, high-level interpretations actually overrode bottom-up stimulus information, such that the pattern of response in early retinotopic cortex to an identified two-tone image was more similar to the response to the photographic version of that stimulus than it was to the response to the identical two-tone image when it was not identified. Our findings are consistent with prior results indicating that perceived size and brightness affect representations in early retinotopic visual cortex and, further, show that even higher-level information--knowledge of object identity--also affects the representation of an object in early retinotopic cortex.

Abstract: Patients with simultanagnosia, which is a component of Balint syndrome, have a restricted spatial window of visual attention and cannot see more than one object at a time. As a result, these patients see the world in a piecemeal fashion, seeing the local components of objects or scenes at the expense of the global picture. To directly test the relationship between the restriction of the attentional window in simultanagnosia and patients' difficulty with global-level processing, we used a gaze-contingent display to create a literal restriction of vision for healthy participants while they performed a global/local identification task. Participants in this viewing condition were instructed to identify the global and local aspects of hierarchical letter stimuli of different sizes and densities. They performed well at the local identification task, and their patterns of inaccuracies for the global level task were highly similar to the pattern of inaccuracies typically seen with simultanagnosic patients. This suggests that a restricted spatial area of visual processing, combined with normal limits to visual processing, can lead to difficulties with global-level perception.

Abstract: When different images are presented to the two eyes, each can intermittently disappear, leaving the other to dominate perception. This is called binocular rivalry. When using radial gratings, focal contrast increments can trigger a traveling wave of perceptual dominance change, originating at the locus of the contrast increment and circling the stimulus. This has been linked to a sweep of activity through V1 that can be traced via fMRI. The dominance of more complex images, like human faces, has been linked to higher level processing structures characterized by more holistic object centered properties. We therefore decided to assess how dominance would spread through more complex images. Using Kanisza squares and human faces we found that dominance tended to spread gradually away from the locus of the contrast increment, often along real or illusory contours. We also found that perceptual dominance was slow to spread between facial regions encoded by different monocular channels. These data are consistent with low-level monocular mechanisms, like those found in V1, playing a determinant role in the spread of perceptual dominance through complex images during binocular rivalry.

Abstract: It is well established that the time to name target objects can be influenced by the presence of categorically related versus unrelated distractor items. A variety of paradigms have been developed to determine the level at which this semantic interference effect occurs in the speech production system. In this study, we investigated one of these tasks, the postcue naming paradigm, for the first time with fMRI. Previous behavioural studies using this paradigm have produced conflicting interpretations of the processing level at which the semantic interference effect takes place, ranging from pre- to post-lexical. Here we used fMRI with a sparse, event-related design to adjudicate between these competing explanations. We replicated the behavioural postcue naming effect for categorically related target/distractor pairs, and observed a corresponding increase in neuronal activation in the right lingual and fusiform gyri-regions previously associated with visual object processing and colour-form integration. We interpret these findings as being consistent with an account that places the semantic interference effect in the postcue paradigm at a processing level involving integration of object attributes in short-term memory.

Abstract: Representing object position is one of the most critical functions of the visual system, but this task is not as simple as reading off an object's retinal coordinates. A rich body of literature has demonstrated that the position in which we perceive an object depends not only on retinotopy but also on factors such as attention, eye movements, object and scene motion, and frames of reference, to name a few. Despite the distinction between perceived and retinal position, strikingly little is known about how or where perceived position is represented in the brain. In the present study, we dissociated retinal and perceived object position to test the relative precision of retina-centered versus percept-centered position coding in a number of independently defined visual areas. In an fMRI experiment, subjects performed a five-alternative forced-choice position discrimination task; our analysis focused on the trials in which subjects misperceived the positions of the stimuli. Using a multivariate pattern analysis to track the coupling of the BOLD response with incremental changes in physical and perceived position, we found that activity in higher level areas--middle temporal complex, fusiform face area, parahippocampal place area, lateral occipital cortex, and posterior fusiform gyrus--more precisely reflected the reported positions than the physical positions of the stimuli. In early visual areas, this preferential coding of perceived position was absent or reversed. Our results demonstrate a new kind of spatial topography present in higher level visual areas in which an object's position is encoded according to its perceived rather than retinal location. We term such percept-centered encoding "perceptotopy".

Abstract: Using an fMR-adaptation paradigm for different face morphing levels we have recently demonstrated a narrow neuronal tuning to faces even at the sub-exemplar level which was tightly related to perceptual discrimination (Gilaie-Dotan and Malach, 2007). However, it is unclear whether this relationship is unique to faces or is a general property of object representations including unfamiliar objects, and whether the adaptation tuning is due to physical changes in the stimulus or to changes in perceptual discrimination. Here we compared the same face-morph paradigm for upright and inverted faces, thus modulating familiarity and perceptual discrimination effects while equating all low-level features. We found, as expected, a perceptual "inversion effect", i.e. a significant reduction in inverted face discrimination. Importantly, the fMR-adaptation tuning in the fusiform face area (FFA) changed in accordance with the different perceptual sensitivity both for upright and inverted faces. Additional object selective regions displayed differential tuning widths to the two categories. Our results are compatible with a model by which the ability of human observers to discriminate objects depends on the shape tuning properties of individual neurons.

Abstract: Sensorimotor-based theories of semantic memory contend that semantic information about an object is represented in the neural substrate invoked when we perceive or interact with it. We used fMRI adaptation to test this prediction, measuring brain activation as participants read pairs of words. Pairs shared function (flashlight-lantern), shape (marble-grape), both (pencil-pen), were unrelated (saucer-needle), or were identical (drill-drill). We observed adaptation for pairs with both function and shape similarity in left premotor cortex. Further, degree of function similarity was correlated with adaptation in three regions: two in the left temporal lobe (left medial temporal lobe, left middle temporal gyrus), which has been hypothesized to play a role in mutimodal integration, and one in left superior frontal gyrus. We also found that degree of manipulation (i.e., action) and function similarity were both correlated with adaptation in two regions: left premotor cortex and left intraparietal sulcus (involved in guiding actions). Additional considerations suggest that the adaptation in these two regions was driven by manipulation similarity alone; thus, these results imply that manipulation information about objects is encoded in brain regions involved in performing or guiding actions. Unexpectedly, these same two regions showed increased activation (rather than adaptation) for objects similar in shape. Overall, we found evidence (in the form of adaptation) that objects that share semantic features have overlapping representations. Further, the particular regions of overlap provide support for the existence of both sensorimotor and amodal/multimodal representations.

Abstract: HIV-1 infection affects white matter circuits linking frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions that subserve visuospatial attention processes. Normal perception requires the integration of details, preferentially processed in the left hemisphere, and the global composition of an object or scene, preferentially processed in the right hemisphere. We tested whether HIV-related callosal white matter degradation contributes to disruption of selective lateralized visuospatial and attention processes. A hierarchical letter target detection paradigm was devised, where large (global) letters were composed of small (local) letters. Participants were required to identify target letters among distractors presented at global, local, both or neither level. Attention was directed to one (global or local) or both levels. Participants were 21 HIV-1 infected and 19 healthy control men and women who also underwent Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). HIV-1 participants showed impaired hierarchical perception owing to abnormally enhanced global facilitation effects but no impairment in attentional control on local-global feature selection. DTI metrics revealed poorer fiber integrity of the corpus callosum in HIV-1 than controls that was more pronounced in posterior than anterior regions. Analysis revealed a double dissociation of anterior and posterior callosal compromise in HIV-1 infection: compromise in anterior but not posterior callosal fiber integrity predicted response conflict elicited by global targets, whereas compromise in posterior but not anterior callosal fiber integrity predicted response facilitation elicited by global targets. We conclude that component processes of visuospatial perception are compromised in HIV-1 infection attributable, at least in part, to degraded callosal microstructural integrity relevant for local-global feature integration.

Abstract: Category information for visually presented objects can be read out from multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activity in ventral-temporal cortex. What is the nature and reliability of these patterns in the absence of any bottom-up visual input, for example, during visual imagery? Here, we first ask how well category information can be decoded for imagined objects and then compare the representations evoked during imagery and actual viewing. In an fMRI study, four object categories (food, tools, faces, buildings) were either visually presented to subjects, or imagined by them. Using pattern classification techniques, we could reliably decode category information (including for non-special categories, i.e., food and tools) from ventral-temporal cortex in both conditions, but only during actual viewing from retinotopic areas. Interestingly, in temporal cortex when the classifier was trained on the viewed condition and tested on the imagery condition, or vice versa, classification performance was comparable to within the imagery condition. The above results held even when we did not use information in the specialized category-selective areas. Thus, the patterns of representation during imagery and actual viewing are in fact surprisingly similar to each other. Consistent with this observation, the maps of "diagnostic voxels" (i.e., the classifier weights) for the perception and imagery classifiers were more similar in ventral-temporal cortex than in retinotopic cortex. These results suggest that in the absence of any bottom-up input, cortical back projections can selectively re-activate specific patterns of neural activity.

Abstract: Context: Previous data suggest a key role of central nervous insulin action in regulating energy homeostasis. Objective: We therefore investigated whether insulin modulates brain responses to food and nonfood pictures in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Design and Patients: Nine healthy, normal-weight subjects underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements to compare the effects of insulin and placebo administration during a visual recognition task with food and nonfood pictures. Insulin was administered intranasally to raise insulin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid without altering systemic effects in the periphery. Metabolic parameters were continuously determined during the experiments. Main Outcome Measure: We measured the changes in brain activity after intranasal insulin administration. Results: Food pictures were detected faster when compared to nonfood pictures in all conditions without any effect of placebo or insulin. After insulin application, functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements showed a significantly reduced activity in the presence of food pictures compared to placebo in the right and left fusiform gyrus, the right hippocampus, the right temporal superior cortex, and the right frontal middle cortex. The brain activation induced by nonfood pictures remained unaffected by insulin. Conclusion: We demonstrate that intranasal insulin led to a reduction of activity in brain areas related to object processing and memory and may have an effect on brain activation with regard to the processing of food pictures. This effect might be part of a mechanism that terminates food intake in the postprandial state.

Abstract: Fingertip force scaling for lifting objects frequently occurs in anticipation of finger contact. An ongoing question concerns the types of memories that are used to inform predictive control. Object-specific information such as weight may be stored and retrieved when previously encountered objects are lifted again. Alternatively, visual size and shape cues may provide estimates of object density each time objects are encountered. We reasoned that differences in performance with familiar versus novel objects would provide support for the former possibility. Anticipatory force production with both familiar and novel objects was assessed in six left hemisphere stroke patients, two of whom exhibited deficient actions with familiar objects (ideomotor apraxia; IMA), along with five control subjects. In contrast to healthy controls and stroke participants without IMA, participants with IMA displayed poor anticipatory scaling with familiar objects. However, like the other groups, IMA participants learned to differentiate fingertip forces with repeated lifts of both familiar and novel objects. Finally, there was a significant correlation between damage to the inferior parietal and superior and middle temporal lobes and impaired anticipatory control for familiar objects. These data support the hypotheses that anticipatory control during lifts of familiar objects in IMA patients are based on object-specific memories and that the ventro-dorsal stream is involved in the long-term storage of internal models used for anticipatory scaling during object manipulation.

Abstract: In real world, objects have multiple features and change dynamically. Thus, object representations must satisfy dynamic updating and feature binding. Previous studies have investigated the neural activity of dynamic updating or feature binding alone, but not both simultaneously. We investigated the neural basis of feature-bound object representation in a dynamically updating situation by conducting a multiple object permanence tracking task, which required observers to simultaneously process both the maintenance and dynamic updating of feature-bound objects. Using an event-related design, we separated activities during memory maintenance and change detection. In the search for regions showing selective activation in dynamic updating of feature-bound objects, we identified a network during memory maintenance that was comprised of the inferior precentral sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and middle frontal gyrus. In the change detection period, various prefrontal regions, including the anterior prefrontal cortex, were activated. In updating object representation of dynamically moving objects, the inferior precentral sulcus closely cooperates with a so-called "frontoparietal network", and subregions of the frontoparietal network can be decomposed into those sensitive to spatial updating and feature binding. The anterior prefrontal cortex identifies changes in object representation by comparing memory and perceptual representations rather than maintaining object representations per se, as previously suggested.

Abstract: This paper presents an automatic method for segmentation of brain structures using their symmetry and tissue type information. The proposed method generates segmented structures that have homogenous tissues. It benefits from general symmetry of the brain structures in the two hemispheres. It also benefits from the tissue regions generated by fuzzy c-means clustering. All in all, the proposed method can be described as a dynamic knowledge-based method that eliminates the need for statistical shape models of the structures while generating accurate segmentation results. The proposed approach is implemented in MATLAB and tested on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) datasets. To this end, it is applied to the segmentation of caudate and ventricles three-dimensionally in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain. Impacts of each of the steps of the proposed approach are demonstrated through experiments. It is shown that the proposed method generates accurate segmentation results that are insensitive to initialization and parameter selection. The proposed method is compared to four previous methods illustrating advantages and limitations of each method.

Abstract: The present study investigated the neural correlates of working memory maintenance for real objects in contrast to their verbal designations. For this purpose we employed a delayed match-to-sample task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The conjunction of load effects for objects and for words revealed a common bilateral network with main foci in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus. Load effect for objects in comparison to load effect for words revealed stronger activation of bilateral precuneus, which suggests the use of mental imagery of objects and object features. The opposite comparison load words versus load objects showed premotor and auditory areas to be activated in association with phonological rehearsal. The bilateral common activation indicates overlapping codes for real-world objects and their verbal designations. Importantly, there is also a dissociation between maintenance of words and objects, which indicates that phonological rehearsal and mental imagery are employed to different degrees.

Abstract: OBJECT: Permanent neurological loss after spinal cord injury (SCI) is a well-known phenomenon. There has also been a growing recognition and improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of late progressive neurological loss, which may occur after SCI as a result of posttraumatic spinal cord tethering (SCT), myelomalacia, and syringomyelia. A clinical study of 404 patients sustaining traumatic SCIs and undergoing surgery to arrest a progressive myelopathy caused by SCT, with or without progressive myelomalacia and cystic cavitation (syringomyelia) was undertaken. Both objective and subjective long-term outcomes were evaluated. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first series of this size correlating long-term patient perception of outcome with long-term objective outcome analyses. METHODS: During the period from January 1993 to November 2003, 404 patients who had previously sustained traumatic SCIs underwent 468 surgeries for progressive myelopathies attributed to tethering of the spinal cord to the surrounding spinal canal, with or without myelomalacia and syrinx formation. Forty-two patients were excluded because of additional pathological entities that were known to contribute to a progressive myelopathy. All surgeries were performed by the same neurosurgeon at a single SCI treatment center and by using a consistent surgical technique of spinal cord detethering, expansion duraplasty, and when indicated, cyst shunting. RESULTS: Outcome data were collected up to 12 years postoperatively. Comparisons of pre- and postoperative American Spinal Injury Association sensory and motor index scores showed no significant change when only a single surgery was required (86% of patients). An outcome questionnaire and phone interview resulted in > 90% of patients self-assessing arrest of functional loss; > 50% of patients self-assessing improvement of function; 17 and 18% self-assessing improvement of motor and sensory functions to a point greater than that achieved at any time postinjury, respectively; 59% reporting improvement of spasticity; and 77% reporting improvement of hyperhidrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for spinal cord detethering, expansion duraplasty, and when indicated, cyst shunting, is a successful treatment strategy for arresting a progressive myelopathy related to posttraumatic SCT and syringomyelia. Results suggest that surgery leads to functional return in ~ 50% of patients, and that in some patients posttraumatic SCT limits maximal recovery of spinal cord function postinjury. A patient's perception of surgery's failure to arrest the progressive myelopathy corresponds closely with the need for repeat surgery because of retethering, cyst reexpansion, and pseudomeningocele formation.

Abstract: Although humans generally experience a coherent sense of selfhood, we can nevertheless articulate different aspects of self. Recent research has demonstrated that one such aspect of self--conceptual knowledge of one's own personality traits--is subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC). Here, we examined whether an alternative aspect of "self"--being an agent who acts to achieve one's own goals--relies on cognitive processes that overlap with or diverge from conceptual operationalizations of selfhood. While undergoing fMRI, participants completed tasks of both conceptual self-reference, in which they judged their own or another person's personality traits, and agentic self-reference, in which they freely chose an object or watched passively as one was chosen. The agentic task failed to modulate vMPFC, despite producing the same memory enhancement frequently observed during conceptual self-referential processing (the "self-reference" effect). Instead, agentic self-reference was associated with activation of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region previously implicated in planning and executing actions. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that IPS activity correlated with later memory performance for the agentic, but not conceptual, task. These results support views of the "self" as a collection of distinct mental operations distributed throughout the brain, rather than a unitary cognitive system.

Abstract: A spatial/nonspatial functional dissociation between the dorsal and ventral visual pathways is well established and has formed the basis of domain-specific theories of prefrontal cortex (PFC). Inconsistencies in the literature regarding prefrontal organization, however, have led to questions regarding whether the nature of the dissociations observed in PFC during working memory are equivalent to those observed in the visual pathways for perception. In particular, the dissociation between dorsal and ventral PFC during working memory for locations versus object identities has been clearly present in some studies but not in others, seemingly in part due to the type of objects used. The current study compared functional MRI activation during delayed-recognition tasks for shape or color, two object features considered to be processed by the ventral pathway for perceptual recognition. Activation for the shape-delayed recognition task was greater than that for the color task in the lateral occipital cortex, in agreement with studies of visual perception. Greater memory-delay activity was also observed, however, in the parietal and superior frontal cortices for the shape than for the color task. Activity in superior frontal cortex was associated with better performance on the shape task. Conversely, greater delay activity for color than for shape was observed in the left anterior insula and this activity was associated with better performance on the color task. These results suggest that superior frontal cortex contributes to performance on tasks requiring working memory for object identities, but it represents different information about those objects than does the ventral frontal cortex.

Abstract: Merging information from multiple senses provides a more reliable percept of our environment. Yet, little is known about where and how various sensory features are combined within the cortical hierarchy. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysics, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying integration of audiovisual object features. Subjects categorized or passively perceived audiovisual object stimuli with the informativeness (i.e., degradation) of the auditory and visual modalities being manipulated factorially. Controlling for low-level integration processes, we show higher level audiovisual integration selectively in the superior temporal sulci (STS) bilaterally. The multisensory interactions were primarily subadditive and even suppressive for intact stimuli but turned into additive effects for degraded stimuli. Consistent with the inverse effectiveness principle, auditory and visual informativeness determine the profile of audiovisual integration in STS similarly to the influence of physical stimulus intensity in the superior colliculus. Importantly, when holding stimulus degradation constant, subjects' audiovisual behavioral benefit predicts their multisensory integration profile in STS: only subjects that benefit from multisensory integration exhibit superadditive interactions, while those that do not benefit show suppressive interactions. In conclusion, superadditive and subadditive integration profiles in STS are functionally relevant and related to behavioral indices of multisensory integration with superadditive interactions mediating successful audiovisual object categorization.

Abstract: Broca's area is preferentially activated by reversible sentences with complex syntax, but various linguistic factors may be responsible for this finding, including syntactic movement, working-memory demands, and post hoc reanalysis. To distinguish between these, we tested the interaction of syntactic complexity and semantic reversibility in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of sentence-picture matching. During auditory comprehension, semantic reversibility induced selective activation throughout the left perisylvian language network. In contrast, syntactic complexity (object-embedded vs. subject-embedded relative clauses) within reversible sentences engaged only the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and left precentral gyrus. Within irreversible sentences, only the LIFG was sensitive to syntactic complexity, confirming a unique role for this region in syntactic processing. Nonetheless, larger effects of reversibility itself occurred in the same regions, suggesting that full syntactic parsing may be a nonautomatic process applied as needed. Complex reversible sentences also induced enhanced signals in LIFG and left precentral regions on subsequent picture selection, but with additional recruitment of the right hemisphere homolog area (right inferior frontal gyrus) as well, suggesting that post hoc reanalysis of sentence structure, compared with initial comprehension, engages an overlapping but larger network of brain regions. These dissociable effects may offer a basis for studying the reorganization of receptive language function after brain damage.

Abstract: Although visual cortical engagement in haptic shape perception is well established, its relationship with visual imagery remains controversial. We addressed this using functional magnetic resonance imaging during separate visual object imagery and haptic shape perception tasks. Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, the haptic shape task employed unfamiliar, meaningless objects, whereas familiar objects were used in the second experiment. The activations evoked by visual object imagery overlapped more extensively, and their magnitudes were more correlated, with those evoked during haptic shape perception of familiar, compared to unfamiliar, objects. In the companion paper (Deshpande et al., this issue), we used task-specific functional and effective connectivity analyses to provide convergent evidence: these analyses showed that the neural networks underlying visual imagery were similar to those underlying haptic shape perception of familiar, but not unfamiliar, objects. We conclude that visual object imagery is more closely linked to haptic shape perception when objects are familiar, compared to when they are unfamiliar.

Abstract: Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia exhibit severe and lasting difficulties in recognizing faces despite the absence of apparent brain abnormalities. We used voxel-based morphometry to investigate whether developmental prosopagnosics show subtle neuroanatomical differences from controls. An analysis based on segmentation of T1-weighted images from 17 developmental prosopagnosics and 18 matched controls revealed that they had reduced grey matter volume in the right anterior inferior temporal lobe and in the superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus bilaterally. In addition, a voxel-based morphometry analysis based on the segmentation of magnetization transfer parameter maps showed that developmental prosopagnosics also had reduced grey matter volume in the right middle fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus. Multiple regression analyses relating three distinct behavioural component scores, derived from a principal component analysis, to grey matter volume revealed an association between a component related to facial identity and grey matter volume in the left superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus plus the right middle fusiform gyrus/inferior temporal gyrus. Grey matter volume in the lateral occipital cortex was associated with component scores related to object recognition tasks. Our results demonstrate that developmental prosopagnosics have reduced grey matter volume in several regions known to respond selectively to faces and provide new evidence that integrity of these areas relates to face recognition ability.

Abstract: Although many studies have found similar cortical areas activated during the recognition of objects encoded through vision or touch, little is known about cortical areas involved in the crossmodal recognition of dynamic objects. Here, we investigated which cortical areas are involved in the recognition of moving objects and were specifically interested in whether motion areas are involved in the recognition of dynamic objects within and across sensory modalities. Prior to scanning, participants first learned to recognise a set of 12 novel objects, each presented either visually or haptically, and either moving or stationary. We then conducted fMRI whilst participants performed an old-new task with static images of learned or not-learned objects. We found the fusiform and right inferior frontal gyri more activated to within-modal visual than crossmodal object recognition. Our results also revealed increased activation in area hMT+, LOC and the middle occipital gyrus, in the right hemisphere only, for the objects learned as moving compared to the learned static objects, regardless of modality. We propose that the network of cortical areas involved in the recognition of dynamic objects is largely independent of modality and have important implications for understanding the neural substrates of multisensory dynamic object recognition.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Recent introduction of multi-detector CT (MDCT) and high-speed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have dramatically advanced visualization and imaging technology in diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in hepatobiliary pancreatic disease. However, image diagnostics have progressed with a background of the essence of anatomy, pathology, and physiology. It is important to object the reflection of the patient's condition and pathology of each disease and remove pattern recognition in what they were depicted as an image. Visualization plays another important role in various medical diagnostics. Trends in scientific visualization will depend on advancements in molecular technology and computer hardware as well as trends in engineering disciplines. METHODS: In this special issue, the recent advances in visualization and imaging in the field of hepatobiliary and pancreatic sciences are featured including application of advanced visualization techniques, data management, data compression, feature extraction. RESULTS: We discuss the potential benefits of new technologies and procedures in hepatobiliary and pancreatic areas, that are circulating tumor cells, MR imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma, indocyanine green using fluorescence under infrared light observation, carbon dioxide enhanced MDCT virtual cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage, natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery, MR-laparoscopy, and image overlay navigation surgery by OsiriX. CONCLUSION: Some of the recent trends are discussed in terms of visualization and imaging in hepatobiliary and pancreatic sciences. The goal in using visualization is to assist existing scientific procedures by providing new insight through visual representation.

Abstract: Words denoting manipulable objects activate sensorimotor brain areas, likely reflecting action experience with the denoted objects. In particular, these sensorimotor lexical representations have been found to reflect the way in which an object is used. In the current paper we present data from two experiments (one behavioral and one neuroimaging) in which we investigate whether body schema information, putatively necessary for interacting with functional objects, is also recruited during lexical processing. To this end, we presented participants with words denoting objects that are typically brought towards or away from the body (e.g., cup or key, respectively). We hypothesized that objects typically brought to a location on the body (e.g., cup) are relatively more reliant on body schema representations, since the final goal location of the cup (i.e., the mouth) is represented primarily through posture and body co-ordinates. In contrast, objects typically brought to a location away from the body (e.g., key) are relatively more dependent on visuo-spatial representations, since the final goal location of the key (i.e., a keyhole) is perceived visually. The behavioral study showed that prior planning of a movement along an axis towards and away from the body facilitates processing of words with a congruent action semantic feature (i.e., preparation of movement towards the body facilitates processing of cup.). In an fMRI study we showed that words denoting objects brought towards the body engage the resources of brain areas involved in the processing information about human bodies (i.e., the extra-striate body area, middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal lobe) relatively more than words denoting objects typically brought away from the body. The results provide converging evidence that body schema are implicitly activated in processing lexical information.

Abstract: Sleep deprivation (SD) affects attention but it is an open question as to whether all subtypes of attention are similarly affected. We investigated the effects of 24 h of total SD on object-selective attention. 26 healthy, young adults viewed quartets of alternating faces or place scenes and performed selective judgments on faces only, scenes only or both faces and scenes. Volunteers underwent fMRI following a normal night of sleep and again following approximately 24 h of total sleep deprivation in a counterbalanced fashion. Sleep deprivation resulted in slower and less accurate picture classification as well as poorer recognition memory for scenes. Attention strongly modulated activation in the Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA). Task-related activation in the fronto-parietal cortex and PPA was reduced in SD, but the relative modulation of PPA activation by attention was preserved. Psychophysiological interaction between the left intra-parietal sulcus and the PPA that was clearly present after a normal night of sleep was reduced below threshold following SD suggesting that PPI may be a more sensitive method of detecting change in selective attention. Sleep deprivation may affect object-selective attention in addition to exerting a task-independent deficit in attention.

Abstract: Traditional theories posit a ventral cortical visual pathway subserving object recognition regardless of the information defining the contour. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown dorsal cortical activity during visual processing of static luminance-defined (SL) and motion-defined form (MDF). It is unknown if this activity is supported behaviorally, or if it depends on central or peripheral vision. The present study compared behavioral performance with two types of MDF [one without translational motion (MDF) and another with (TM)] and SL shapes in a shape matching task where shape pairs appeared in the upper or lower visual fields or along the horizontal meridian of central or peripheral vision. MDF matching was superior to the other contour types regardless of location in central vision. Both MDF and TM matching was superior to SL matching for presentations in peripheral vision. Importantly, there was an advantage for MDF and TM matching in the lower peripheral visual field that was not present for SL forms. These results are consistent with previous behavioral findings that show no field advantage for static form processing and a lower field advantage for motion processing. They are also suggestive of more dorsal cortical involvement in the processing of shapes defined by motion than luminance.

Abstract: Selective visual attention directed to a location (even in the absence of a stimulus) increases activity in the corresponding regions of visual cortex and enhances the speed and accuracy of target perception. We further explored top-down influences on perceptual representations by manipulating observers' expectations about the category of an upcoming target. Observers viewed a display in which an object (either a face or a house) gradually emerged from a state of phase-scrambled noise; a cue established expectation about the object category. Observers were faster to categorize faces (gender discrimination) or houses (structural discrimination) when the category of the partially scrambled object matched their expectation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that this expectation was associated with anticipatory increases in category-specific visual cortical activity, even in the absence of object- or category-specific visual information. Expecting a face evoked increased activity in face-selective cortical regions in the fusiform gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. Conversely, expecting a house increased activity in parahippocampal gyrus. These results suggest that visual anticipation facilitates subsequent perception by recruiting, in advance, the same cortical mechanisms as those involved in perception.

In order to study involved neuronal circuitry, we assessed cerebral activation patterns both before and during recognition of gradually revealed images in Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations (PDwithVHs), Parkinson's disease patients without visual hallucinations (PDnonVHs) and healthy controls. We hypothesized that, before image recognition, PDwithVHs would show reduced bottom-up visual activation in occipital-temporal areas and increased (pre)frontal activation, reflecting increased top-down demand. Overshoot of the latter has been proposed to play a role in generating visual hallucinations. Nine non-demented PDwithVHs, 14 PDnonVHs and 13 healthy controls were scanned on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Static images of animals and objects gradually appearing out of random visual noise were used in an event-related design paradigm. Analyses were time-locked on the moment of image recognition, indicated by the subjects' button-press. Subjects were asked to press an additional button on a colour-changing fixation dot, to keep attention and motor action constant and to assess reaction times. Data pre-processing and statistical analysis were performed with statistical parametric mapping-5 software. Bilateral activation of the fusiform and lingual gyri was seen during image recognition in all groups (P < 0.001). Several seconds before image recognition, PDwithVHs showed reduced activation of the lateral occipital cortex, compared with both PDnonVHs and healthy controls. In addition, reduced activation of extrastriate temporal visual cortices was seen just before image recognition in PDwithVHs. The association between increased vulnerability for visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease and impaired visual object processing in occipital and temporal extrastriate visual cortices supported the hypothesis of impaired bottom-up visual processing in PDwithVHs. Support for the hypothesized increased top-down frontal activation was not obtained. The finding of activation reductions in ventral/lateral visual association cortices in PDwithVHs before image recognition further helps to explain functional mechanisms underlying visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Different items in long-term knowledge are stored in the neocortex as partially overlapping representations that can be altered slightly with usage. This encoding scheme affords well-documented benefits, but potential costs have not been well explored. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neurocomputational modeling, and electrophysiological measures to show that strengthening some visual object representations not only enhances the subsequent ability to identify those (repeated) objects-an effect long known as repetition priming-but also impairs the ability to identify other (non-repeated) objects-a new effect labeled antipriming. As a result, the non-repeated objects elicit increased neural activity likely for the purpose of reestablishing their previously weakened representations. These results suggest a novel reevaluation of the ubiquitously observed repetition effect on neural activity, and they indicate that maintenance relearning may be a crucial aspect of preserving overlapping neural representations of visual objects in long-term memory.

Abstract: When we identify a visual object such as a word or letter our ability to detect a second object is impaired if it appears within 500 ms of the first. This outcome has been named the 'attentional blink' (AB) and has been the topic of numerous research reports since 1992 when the first AB paper was published. During the first decade of research on this topic, the focus has been on 'behavioural' approaches to understanding the AB phenomenon, with manipulations made on stimulus parameters (e.g. type and spatial distribution), nature of the stimuli (uni-modal or cross-modal) and importantly the role of masking. More recently, researchers have begun to focus on neurophysiological underpinnings of the AB studying patients with focal lesions and using approaches such as ERP, TMS, fMRI and MEG. My chapter presents the results of a number of such neurophysiological techniques, suggesting that localisation, in combination with activation and synchronisation methods have begun to unravel a dynamic temporo-parietal frontal network of structures involved in the AB.

Abstract: In the preceding paper (Lacey, S., Flueckiger, P., Stilla, R., Lava, M., Sathian, K., 2009a. Object familiarity modulates involvement of visual imagery in haptic shape perception), we showed that the activations evoked by visual imagery overlapped more extensively, and their magnitudes were more correlated, with those evoked during haptic shape perception of familiar, compared to unfamiliar, objects. Here we used task-specific analyses of functional and effective connectivity to provide convergent evidence. These analyses showed that the visual imagery and familiar haptic shape tasks activated similar networks, whereas the unfamiliar haptic shape task activated a different network. Multivariate Granger causality analyses of effective connectivity, in both a conventional form and one purged of zero-lag correlations, showed that the visual imagery and familiar haptic shape networks involved top-down paths from prefrontal cortex into the lateral occipital complex (LOC), whereas the unfamiliar haptic shape network was characterized by bottom-up, somatosensory inputs into the LOC. We conclude that shape representations in the LOC are flexibly accessible, either top-down or bottom-up, according to task demands, and that visual imagery is more involved in LOC activation during haptic shape perception when objects are familiar, compared to unfamiliar.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that human ventral visual cortex anterior to human visual area V4 contains two visual field maps, VO-1 and VO-2, that together form the ventral occipital (VO) cluster (Brewer et al., 2005). This cluster is characterized by common functional response properties and responds preferentially to color and object stimuli. Here, we confirm the topographic and functional characteristics of the VO cluster and describe two new visual field maps that are located anterior to VO-2 extending across the collateral sulcus into the posterior parahippocampal cortex (PHC). We refer to these visual field maps as parahippocampal areas PHC-1 and PHC-2. Each PHC map contains a topographic representation of contralateral visual space. The polar angle representation in PHC-1 extends from regions near the lower vertical meridian (that is the shared border with VO-2) to those close to the upper vertical meridian (that is the shared border with PHC-2). The polar angle representation in PHC-2 is a mirror reversal of the PHC-1 representation. PHC-1 and PHC-2 share a foveal representation and show a strong bias toward representations of peripheral eccentricities. Both the foveal and peripheral representations of PHC-1 and PHC-2 respond more strongly to scenes than to objects or faces, with greater scene preference in PHC-2 than PHC-1. Importantly, both areas heavily overlap with the functionally defined parahippocampal place area. Our results suggest that ventral visual cortex can be subdivided on the basis of topographic criteria into a greater number of discrete maps than previously thought.

Abstract: Differences in the horizontal positions of retinal images--binocular disparity--provide important cues for three-dimensional object recognition and manipulation. We investigated the neural coding of three-dimensional shape defined by disparity in anterior intraparietal (AIP) area. Robust selectivity for disparity-defined slanted and curved surfaces was observed in a high proportion of AIP neurons, emerging at relatively short latencies. The large majority of AIP neurons preserved their three-dimensional shape preference over different positions in depth, a hallmark of higher-order disparity selectivity. Yet both stimulus type (concave-convex) and position in depth could be reliably decoded from the AIP responses. The neural coding of three-dimensional shape was based on first-order (slanted surfaces) and second-order (curved surfaces) disparity selectivity. Many AIP neurons tolerated the presence of disparity discontinuities in the stimulus, but the population of AIP neurons provided reliable information on the degree of curvedness of the stimulus. Finally, AIP neurons preserved their three-dimensional shape preference over different positions in the frontoparallel plane. Thus, AIP neurons extract or have access to three-dimensional object information defined by binocular disparity, consistent with previous functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Unlike the known representation of three-dimensional shape in inferior temporal cortex, the neural representation in AIP appears to emphasize object parameters required for the planning of grasping movements.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for correcting the geometric and greyscale distortions in diffusion-weighted MRI that result from inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field. These inhomogeneities may due to imperfections in the magnet or to spatial variations in the magnetic susceptibility of the object being imaged--so called susceptibility artifacts. Echo-planar imaging (EPI), used in virtually all diffusion weighted acquisition protocols, assumes a homogeneous static field, which generally does not hold for head MRI. The resulting distortions are significant, sometimes more than ten millimeters. These artifacts impede accurate alignment of diffusion images with structural MRI, and are generally considered an obstacle to the joint analysis of connectivity and structure in head MRI. In principle, susceptibility artifacts can be corrected by acquiring (and applying) a field map. However, as shown in the literature and demonstrated in this paper, field map corrections of susceptibility artifacts are not entirely accurate and reliable, and thus field maps do not produce reliable alignment of EPIs with corresponding structural images. This paper presents a new, image-based method for correcting susceptibility artifacts. The method relies on a variational formulation of the match between an EPI baseline image and a corresponding T2-weighted structural image but also specifically accounts for the physics of susceptibility artifacts. We derive a set of partial differential equations associated with the optimization, describe the numerical methods for solving these equations, and present results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with field-map correction.

Abstract: Models of object appearance based on principal components analysis provide powerful and versatile tools in computer vision and medical image analysis. A major shortcoming is that they rely entirely on the training data to extract principal modes of appearance variation and ignore underlying variables (e.g., subject age, gender). This paper introduces an appearance modeling framework based instead on generalized multi-linear regression. The training of regression appearance models is controlled by independent variables. This makes it straightforward to create model instances for specific values of these variables, which is akin to model interpolation. We demonstrate the new framework by creating an appearance model of the human brain from MR images of 36 subjects. Instances of the model created for different ages are compared with average shape atlases created from age-matched sub-populations. Relative tissue volumes vs. age in models are also compared with tissue volumes vs. subject age in the original images. In both experiments, we found excellent agreement between the regression models and the comparison data. We conclude that regression appearance models are a promising new technique for image analysis, with one potential application being the representation of a continuum of mutually consistent, age-specific atlases of the human brain.

Abstract: Distinct regions within the ventral visual pathway show neural specialization for nonliving and living stimuli (e.g., tools, houses versus animals, faces). The causes of these category preferences are widely debated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that the same regions of the ventral stream that show category preferences for nonliving stimuli and animals in sighted adults show the same category preferences in adults who are blind since birth. Both blind and sighted participants had larger blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in the medial fusiform gyrus for nonliving stimuli compared to animal stimuli and differential BOLD responses in lateral occipital cortex for animal stimuli compared to nonliving stimuli. These findings demonstrate that the medial-to-lateral bias by conceptual domain in the ventral visual pathway does not require visual experience in order to develop and suggest the operation of innately determined domain-specific constraints on the organization of object knowledge.

Abstract: Previous behavioral studies suggest that response measures related to the body, such as pointing, serve to anchor participants to their physical body during mental rotation tasks in which their perspective must be shifted elsewhere. This study investigated whether such measures engage spatial and low-level cortical motor areas of the brain more readily than non-body-related measures. We directly compared activation found in two imagined perspective rotation tasks, using responses that varied in the degree to which they emphasized the human body. In the body minimize condition, participants imagined rotating themselves around an object and judged whether a prescribed part of the object would be visible from the imagined viewpoint. In the body maximize condition, participants imagined rotating around the object and then located the prescribed object part with respect to their bodies. A direct comparison of neural activation in both conditions revealed distinct yet overlapping neural regions. The body maximize condition yielded activation in low-level cortical motor areas such as premotor cortex and primary motor cortex, as well as bilateral spatial processing areas. The body minimize condition yielded activation in nonmotoric egocentric processing regions. However, both conditions showed activation in the parietal-occipital region that is thought to be involved in egocentric transformations. These findings are discussed in the context of recent hypotheses regarding the role of the body percept in imagined egocentric transformations.

Abstract: Recent research indicates that language processing relies on brain areas dedicated to perception and action. For example, processing words denoting manipulable objects has been shown to activate a fronto-parietal network involved in actual tool use. This is suggested to reflect the knowledge the subject has about how objects are moved and used. However, information about how to use an object may be much more central to the conceptual representation of an object than information about how to move an object. Therefore, there may be much more fine-grained distinctions between objects on the neural level, especially related to the usability of manipulable objects. In the current study, we investigated whether a distinction can be made between words denoting (1) objects that can be picked up to move (e.g., volumetrically manipulable objects: bookend, clock) and (2) objects that must be picked up to use (e.g., functionally manipulable objects: cup, pen). The results show that functionally manipulable words elicit greater levels of activation in the fronto-parietal sensorimotor areas than volumetrically manipulable words. This suggests that indeed a distinction can be made between different types of manipulable objects. Specifically, how an object is used functionally rather than whether an object can be displaced with the hand is reflected in semantic representations in the brain.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have implicated the left prefrontal cortex in priming. We tested the hypothesis that object encoding activity in different prefrontal cortex regions selectively predicts subsequent object priming and recognition respectively. Participants were scanned whilst making semantic category judgements about novel object pictures. One week later priming and recognition of these objects were tested. Encoding that produced long-lasting priming in the absence of recognition memory was associated with increased activity in left inferior prefrontal (BA 47) and superior frontal (BA 8) cortices. In contrast, encoding that produced object recognition one week later activated the left middle frontal cortex (BA 9). This is consistent with other evidence indicating that object priming and recognition are independent kind of memory. Problems of measuring item-by-item recognition and priming together are discussed.

Abstract: The perirhinal and entorhinal cortices are critical components of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) declarative memory system. Study of their specific functions using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), however, has suffered from severe magnetic susceptibility signal dropout resulting in poor temporal signal-to-noise (tSNR) and thus weak BOLD signal detectability. We have demonstrated that higher spatial resolution in the z-plane leads to improved BOLD fMRI signal quality in the anterior medial temporal lobes when using a 16-element surface coil array at 3 T (Tesla). Using this technique, the present study investigated the roles of the anterior medial temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, in both object and spatial memory. Participants viewed a series of fractal images and were instructed to encode either the object's identity or location. Object and spatial recognition memory were tested after 18-sec delays. Both the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices were active during the object and spatial encoding tasks. In both regions, object encoding was biased to the left hemisphere, whereas spatial encoding was biased to the right. A similar hemispheric bias was evident for recognition memory. Recent animal studies suggest functional dissociations among regions of the entorhinal cortex for spatial vs. object processing. Our findings suggest that this process-specific distinction may be expressed in the human brain as a hemispheric division of labor.

Abstract: Observers were scanned while they watched a video of an actor using an object. Three conditions were contrasted in which the same object was used: (i) normally (e.g. using a tennis racket to hit a ball), (ii) in an unusual way (e.g. using a tennis racket to strain spaghetti), (iii) in a pretend play (e.g. playing a tennis racket like a banjo). Observing real and unusual uses of objects activated areas previously seen in studies of tool use including areas associated with a mirror system for action. Observing pretend play activated additional areas previously associated with theory of mind tasks and listening to narrative, including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus and temporal poles. After presentation of each video, observers were asked to name the object as used in the preceding action video (e.g. racket, sieve or banjo). Naming the pretend object elicited activity in medial prefrontal cortex. These results are consistent with proposals that pretend play is a form of communicative narrative, associated with the ability to mentalize. However, this leaves open the question as to whether pretence or mentalizing is the more basic process.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between the configural and part-based systems in face recognition is the major aim of this study. Specifically, we established whether configural representation of faces contribute to aspects of face recognition that depend on part-based processes, such as identifying inverted or fractured faces. Using face recognition tasks that require part-based or configural processing, we compared the results of CK--a man who has object agnosia and alexia [Moscovitch, M., Winocur, G., & Behrmann, M. (1997). What is special about face recognition? Nineteen experiments on a person with visual object agnosia and dyslexia but normal face recognition. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 9(5), 555-604] but normal upright face recognition, to those of DC--a man who has prosopagnosia but normal object recognition. CK was normal at recognizing faces if configural processing was sufficient, but poor at recognizing faces that were modified so as to alter their gestalt, and require part-based processing (Moscovitch et al.). DC was impaired at recognizing upright faces and his performance declined in all tasks involving recognition of modified faces, including those that depend on part-based and on configural processing. Nevertheless, DC was normal on tasks involving perception of generic faces and face imagery. These results show that although configural face perception can proceed without part-based processing, the reverse is not the case. Our results suggest that the configural system is always necessary for face recognition, and appears to support what remains of face identification even in prosopagnosic people who have an intact part-based system.

Abstract: The semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is characterized by the combination of word comprehension deficits, fluent aphasia and a particularly severe anomia. In this study, two novel tasks were used to explore the factors contributing to the anomia. The single most common factor was a blurring of distinctions among members of a semantic category, leading to errors of overgeneralization in word-object matching tasks as well as in word definitions and object descriptions. This factor was more pronounced for natural kinds than artifacts. In patients with the more severe anomias, conceptual maps were more extensively disrupted so that inter-category distinctions were as impaired as intra-category distinctions. Many objects that could not be named aloud could be matched to the correct word in patients with mild but not severe anomia, reflecting a gradual intensification of the semantic factor as the naming disorder becomes more severe. Accurate object descriptions were more frequent than accurate word definitions and all patients experienced prominent word comprehension deficits that interfered with everyday activities but no consequential impairment of object usage or face recognition. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed three characteristics: greater atrophy of the left hemisphere; atrophy of anterior components of the perisylvian language network in the superior and middle temporal gyri; and atrophy of anterior components of the face and object recognition network in the inferior and medial temporal lobes. The left sided asymmetry and perisylvian extension of the atrophy explains the more profound impairment of word than object usage and provides the anatomical basis for distinguishing the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia from the partially overlapping group of patients that fulfil the widely accepted diagnostic criteria for semantic dementia.

Abstract: Mu (mu) rhythms are EEG oscillations between 8-13 Hz distinguished from alpha by having more anterior distribution and being desynchronized by motor rather than visual activity. Evidence accumulating during the last decade suggests that the desynchronization of mu rhythms (mu suppression) might be also a manifestation of a human Mirror Neuron System (MNS). To further explore this hypothesis we used a paradigm that, in a previous fMRI study, successfully activated this putative MNS in humans. Our direct goal was to provide further support for a link between modulation of mu rhythms and the MNS, by finding parallels between the reported patterns of fMRI activations and patterns of mu suppression. The EEG power in the mu range has been recorded while participants passively observed either a left or a right hand, reaching to and grasping objects, and compared it with that recorded while participants observed the movement of a ball, and while observing static grasping scenes or still objects. Mirroring fMRI results (Shmuelof, L., Zohary, E., 2005. Dissociation between ventral and dorsal fMRI activation during object and action recognition. Neuron 47, 457-470), mu suppression was larger in the hemisphere contra-lateral to the moving hand and larger when the hands grasped different objects in different ways than when the movement was repetitive. No suppression was found while participants observed still objects but mu suppression was also found while seeing static grasping postures. These data are discussed in light of similar parallels between modulations of alpha waves and fMRI while recording EEG in the magnet. The present data support a link between mu suppression and a human MNS.

Abstract: The medial temporal lobe (MTL), a set of heavily interconnected structures including the hippocampus and underlying entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex, is traditionally believed to be part of a unitary system dedicated to declarative memory. Recent studies, however, demonstrated perceptual impairments in amnesic individuals with MTL damage, with hippocampal lesions causing scene discrimination deficits, and perirhinal lesions causing object and face discrimination deficits. The degree of impairment on these tasks was influenced by the need to process complex conjunctions of features: discriminations requiring the integration of multiple visual features caused deficits, whereas discriminations that could be solved on the basis of a single feature did not. Here, we address these issues with functional neuroimaging in healthy participants as they performed a version of the oddity discrimination task used previously in patients. Three different types of stimuli (faces, scenes, novel objects) were presented from either identical or different viewpoints. Consistent with studies in patients, we observed increased perirhinal activity when participants distinguished between faces and objects presented from different, compared to identical, viewpoints. The posterior hippocampus, by contrast, showed an effect of viewpoint for both faces and scenes. These findings provide convergent evidence that the MTL is involved in processes beyond long-term declarative memory and suggest a critical role for these structures in integrating complex features of faces, objects, and scenes into view-invariant, abstract representations.

Abstract: According to perceptual load theory, processing of task-irrelevant stimuli is limited by the perceptual load of a parallel attended task if both the task and the irrelevant stimuli are presented to the same sensory modality. However, it remains a matter of debate whether the same principles apply to cross-sensory perceptual load and, more generally, what form cross-sensory attentional modulation in early perceptual areas takes in humans. Here we addressed these questions using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants undertook an auditory one-back working memory task of low or high perceptual load, while concurrently viewing task-irrelevant images at one of three object visibility levels. The processing of the visual and auditory stimuli was measured in the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and auditory cortex (AC), respectively. Cross-sensory interference with sensory processing was observed in both the LOC and AC, in accordance with previous results of unisensory perceptual load studies. The present neuroimaging results therefore warrant the extension of perceptual load theory from a unisensory to a cross-sensory context: a validation of this cross-sensory interference effect through behavioural measures would consolidate the findings.

Abstract: Efficient recognition of odorous objects universally shapes animal behavior and is crucial for survival. To distinguish kin from nonkin, mate from nonmate and food from nonfood, organisms must be able to create meaningful perceptual representations of odor qualities and categories. It is currently unknown where and in what form the brain encodes information about odor quality. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate (pattern-based) techniques, we found that spatially distributed ensemble activity in human posterior piriform cortex (PPC) coincides with perceptual ratings of odor quality, such that odorants with more (or less) similar fMRI patterns were perceived as more (or less) alike. We did not observe these effects in anterior piriform cortex, amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex, indicating that ensemble coding of odor categorical perception is regionally specific for PPC. These findings substantiate theoretical models emphasizing the importance of distributed piriform templates for the perceptual reconstruction of odor object quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved region-based active contour model in a variational level set formulation. We define an energy functional with a local intensity fitting term, which induces a local force to attract the contour and stops it at object boundaries, and an auxiliary global intensity fitting term, which drives the motion of the contour far away from object boundaries. Therefore, the combination of these two forces allows for flexible initialization of the contours. This energy is then incorporated into a level set formulation with a level set regularization term that is necessary for accurate computation in the corresponding level set method. The proposed model is first presented as a two-phase level set formulation and then extended to a multi-phase formulation. Experimental results show the advantages of our method in terms of accuracy and robustness. In particular, our method has been applied to brain MR image segmentation with desirable results.

Abstract: Animacy helps to identify objects as living entities. To test the hypothesis that the perception of animacy via visual motion cues is represented in the same ventral visual pathways associated with living object identification through static visual information processing, 28 normal volunteers underwent functional MRI whilst tracking the movements of a self-propelling object. The target movement was held constant between conditions, whilst the animacy was externally manipulated by the presence of "chasers", from which the target was perceived to be escaping, and by "obstacles", which were static geometric objects with which the target avoided collision. The perception of target animacy was most powerfully induced by chasers, and a proximity effect was more prominently produced by obstacles. Animacy as induced by a chaser was associated with effects in the bilateral occipital poles (OPs) and the left inferior temporal gyrus to the lateral occipital complex (LOC). The LOC showed a stronger animacy effect, relative to the proximity effect, than the OPs. The effective connectivity between the LOC and the OPs was bi-directionally enhanced by the chasers. These findings suggest that both the LOC and the OPs play important roles in the identification of animated entities through the integration of information about the relationships between objects encoded in retinotopic coordinates.

Abstract: Real-life visual object recognition requires the processing of more than just geometric (shape, size, and orientation) properties. Surface properties such as color and texture are equally important, particularly for providing information about the material properties of objects. Recent neuroimaging research suggests that geometric and surface properties are dealt with separately within the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and the collateral sulcus (CoS), respectively. Here we compared objects that differed either in aspect ratio or in surface texture only, keeping all other visual properties constant. Results on brain-intact participants confirmed that surface texture activates an area in the posterior CoS, quite distinct from the area activated by shape within LOC. We also tested 2 patients with visual object agnosia, one of whom (DF) performed well on the texture task but at chance on the shape task, whereas the other (MS) showed the converse pattern. This behavioral double dissociation was matched by a parallel neuroimaging dissociation, with activation in CoS but not LOC in patient DF and activation in LOC but not CoS in patient MS. These data provide presumptive evidence that the areas respectively activated by shape and texture play a causally necessary role in the perceptual discrimination of these features.

Abstract: Hippocampal lesions in rodents impair both object-place and odor-place associative memory. Subjects with hippocampal damage have impaired associative memory such as object-place memory. Whereas studies have investigated some types of associative memory, no investigation has specifically examined odor-place associative memory in subjects with well-defined amnesia. It is unknown whether amnesic subjects with hippocampal damage would be impaired on an odor-place associative task. We investigated the effect of hippocampal damage in amnesic subjects with hippocampal atrophy on odor-place associative memory and recognition memory tasks. Amnesic and healthy comparison subjects matched for age and education were tested on an odor-place associative task, an odor recognition task, and a place recognition task. The odor-place associative task required subjects to associate 6 odors with 6 spatial locations on a board. The recognition tasks required subjects to identify the 6 odors and the 6 locations that were presented during the associative task. Amnesic subjects were impaired for odor-place memory and place recognition, but not odor recognition compared with comparison subjects. These results suggest that the human hippocampus is necessary for odor-place associative memory and spatial recognition memory. These data provide support for the idea that odor-place associative memory is mediated by the hippocampus in both humans and rodents, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in cognitive function assigned to the hippocampus.

Abstract: OBJECT: Anterior choroidal artery (AChA) aneurysms are difficult to treat, and the clinical outcome of patients is occasionally compromised by ischemic complications after clipping operations. The purpose of this study was to document the outcome and follow-up results of endovascular coil embolization in patients with AChA aneurysms. METHODS: Between July 1999 and March 2008, 88 patients with 90 AChA aneurysms (31 ruptured and 59 unruptured aneurysms) were treated with endovascular coil embolization in 91 sessions. There were 87 small aneurysms (< 10 mm) and 3 large aneurysms, with a mean aneurysm volume of 60.9 +/- 83.3 mm(3). Preprocedural oculomotor nerve palsy associated with AChA aneurysms was noted in 8 patients. Efficacy and safety were evaluated based on the degree of initial occlusion, procedure-related complications, patient outcome based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale score, and follow-up results. RESULTS: The degree of angiographic occlusion of the aneurysms was complete for 15 aneurysms (17%), near complete for 69 aneurysms (77%) and partial for 6 aneurysms (7%). There were 4 (4.4%) symptomatic procedure-related complications (3 thromboembolic events and 1 procedural hemorrhage). The procedural hemorrhage resulted in death; however, the thromboembolic events only caused transient deficits. A favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5 or 4) was achieved in 90% (79 of 88) of the patients at the time of discharge. No patient showed signs of bleeding or rebleeding during the follow-up period (mean 25 months). Major aneurysm recanalization occurred in 2 cases. The AChA aneurysm-associated oculomotor nerve palsy tended to become aggravated transiently after coil embolization and then completely recovered over the course of 2-9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Coil embolization is a safe and effective treatment modality in cases of AChA aneurysms. Coil embolization enables procedural recognition of arterial compromise and immediate reestablishment of flow, thus contributing to a favorable outcome.

Abstract: The parahippocampal place area (PPA) is a region of human cortex that responds more strongly to visual scenes (e.g., landscapes or cityscapes) than to other visual stimuli. It has been proposed that the primary function of the PPA is encoding of contextual information about object co-occurrence. Supporting this context hypothesis are reports that the PPA responds more strongly to strong-context than to weak-context objects and more strongly to famous faces (for which contextual associations are available) than to nonfamous faces. We reexamined the reliability of these 2 effects by scanning subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed strong- and weak-context objects, scrambled versions of these objects, and famous and nonfamous faces. "Contextual" effects for objects were observed to be reliable in the PPA at slow presentation rates but not at faster presentation rates intended to discourage scene imagery. We were unable to replicate the earlier finding of preferential PPA response to famous versus nonfamous faces. These results are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the PPA encodes contextual associations but are consistent with a competing hypothesis that the PPA encodes scenic layout.

Abstract: We report a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation study of two well-described patients, DF and PS, who present face identity recognition impairments (prosopagnosia) following brain-damage. Comparing faces to non-face objects elicited activation in all visual areas of the cortical face processing network that were spared subsequent to brain damage. The common brain lesion in the two patients was in the right inferior occipital cortex, in the territory of the right "occipital face area" ('OFA'), which strengthens the critical role of this region in processing faces. Despite the lesion to the right 'OFA', there was normal range of sensitivity to faces in the right "fusiform face area" ('FFA') in both patients, supporting a non-hierarchical model of face processing at the cortical level. At the same time, however, sensitivity to individual face representations, as indicated by release from adaptation to identity, was abnormal in the right 'FFA' of both patients. This suggests that the right 'OFA' is necessary to individualize faces, perhaps through reentrant interactions with other cortical face sensitive areas. The lateral occipital area (LO) is damaged bilaterally in patient DF, who also shows visual object agnosia. However, in patient PS, in whom LO was spared, sensitivity to individual representations of non-face objects was still found in this region, as in the normal brain, consistent with her preserved object recognition abilities. Taken together, these observations, which fruitfully combine functional imaging and neuropsychology, place strong constraints on the possible functional organization of the cortical areas mediating face processing in the human brain.

Abstract: Previous work using functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the identities of isolated objects viewed by human subjects can be extracted from distributed patterns of brain activity. Outside the laboratory, however, objects almost never appear in isolation; thus it is important to understand how multiple simultaneously occurring objects are encoded by the visual system. We used multivoxel pattern analysis to examine this issue, testing whether activity patterns in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) evoked by object pairs showed an ordered relationship to patterns evoked by their constituent objects. Applying a searchlight analysis to identify voxels with the highest signal-to-noise ratios, we found that responses to object pairs within these informative voxels were well predicted by the averages of responses to their constituent objects. Consistent with this result, we were able to classify object pairs by using synthetic patterns created by averaging single-object patterns. These results indicate that the representation of multiple objects in LOC is governed by a response normalization mechanism similar to that reported in visual areas of several nonhuman species. They also suggest a population coding scheme that preserves information about multiple objects under conditions of distributed attention, facilitating fast object and scene recognition during natural vision.

Abstract: The human brain contains cortical areas specialized in representing object categories. Visual experience is known to change the responses in these category-selective areas of the brain. However, little is known about how category training specifically affects cortical category selectivity. Here, we investigated the experience-dependent formation of object categories using an fMRI adaptation paradigm. Outside the scanner, subjects were trained to categorize artificial bird types into arbitrary categories (jungle birds and desert birds). After training, neuronal populations in the occipito-temporal cortex, such as the fusiform and the lateral occipital gyrus, were highly sensitive to perceptual stimulus differences. This sensitivity was not present for novel birds, indicating experience-related changes in neuronal representations. Neurons in STS showed category selectivity. A release from adaptation in STS was only observed when two birds in a pair crossed the category boundary. This dissociation could not be explained by perceptual similarities because the physical difference between birds from the same side of the category boundary and between birds from opposite sides of the category boundary was equal. Together, the occipito-temporal cortex and the STS have the properties suitable for a system that can both generalize across stimuli and discriminate between them.

Abstract: We investigated 0.01-0.08Hz low-frequency fluctuations of BOLD-fMRI signals in the face and object-responsive regions during the resting-state and during face or object viewing tasks. By comparing the effects of the face-responsive regions of interest with those of the object-responsive regions of interest, we observed a distributed cortical network of face perception during the resting-state among posterior fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus. This network was also significantly activated during the face perception task. The face perception task also activated additional areas in the frontal and parietal regions. Our results suggest that the "core" but not the "extended" network for face processing is already in some form of activation during the resting-state. A possible function of the resting-state face perception network is perhaps to prepare the brain to process faces that individuals are highly likely to encounter in their environment.

Abstract: Human observers readily identify objects with moving parts, and recognize their underlying structure even when the component parts undergo complex movement. This suggests the existence of neural representations that are invariant to motion and state of articulation, which together allow our visual system to maintain 'object constancy'. Ventral temporal cortex has previously been implicated in object perception and in coding object identity, but it is unclear where this is achieved when objects undergo motion-driven shape changes. In the present study, we use fMRI adaptation to probe the neural response properties when subjects view dynamic novel objects. Our results reveal neural selectivity for novel objects in the LOC region of the occipito-temporal lobe, even when those objects are viewed as moving and articulating. We also identify a bilateral area of posterior fusiform outside of the LOC with neural populations invariant to changes in the articulatory state of an object, a critical feature of object constancy. These results demonstrate the functional importance of ventral temporal cortex in the perception of moving objects, and the existence of neural populations coding for object constancy across movement and articulation.

Abstract: The posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) region plays an important role in the perception of social acts, although its full role has not been completely clarified. This functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment examined activity in the STS region as participants viewed actions that were congruent or incongruent with intentions established by a previous emotional context. Participants viewed an actress express either a positive or a negative emotion toward one of two objects and then subsequently pick up one of them. If the object that was picked up had received positive regard, or if the object that was not picked up had received negative regard, the action was congruent; otherwise, the action was incongruent. Activity in the right posterior STS region was sensitive to the congruency between the action and the actress's emotional expression (i.e., STS activity was greater on incongruent than on congruent trials). These findings suggest that the posterior STS represents not only biological motion, but also how another person's motion is related to his or her intentions.

Abstract: The influential model on visual information processing by Milner and Goodale (1995) has suggested a dissociation between action- and perception-related processing in a dorsal versus ventral stream projection. It was inspired substantially by the observation of a double dissociation of disturbed visual action versus perception in patients with optic ataxia on the one hand and patients with visual form agnosia (VFA) on the other. Unfortunately, almost all cases with VFA reported so far suffered from inhalational intoxication, the majority with carbon monoxide (CO). Since CO induces a diffuse and widespread pattern of neuronal and white matter damage throughout the whole brain, precise conclusions from these patients with VFA on the selective role of ventral stream structures for shape and orientation perception were difficult. Here, we report patient J.S., who demonstrated VFA after a well circumscribed brain lesion due to stroke etiology. Like the famous patient D.F. with VFA after CO intoxication studied by Milner, Goodale, and coworkers (Goodale et al., 1991, 1994; Milner et al., 1991; Servos et al., 1995; Mon-Williams et al., 2001a,b; Wann et al., 2001; Westwood et al., 2002; McIntosh et al., 2004; Schenk and Milner, 2006), J.S. showed an obvious dissociation between disturbed visual perception of shape and orientation information on the one side and preserved visuomotor abilities based on the same information on the other. In both hemispheres, damage primarily affected the fusiform and the lingual gyri as well as the adjacent posterior cingulate gyrus. We conclude that these medial structures of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex are integral for the normal flow of shape and of contour information into the ventral stream system allowing to recognize objects.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To use MRI diffusion-tensor tracking (DTT) to test for the presence of unknown neuronal fiber pathways interconnecting the mid-fusiform cortex and anteromedial temporal lobe in humans. Such pathways are hypothesized to exist because these regions coactivate in functional MRI (fMRI) studies of emotion-valued faces and words, suggesting a functional link that could be mediated by neuronal connections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 normal human subjects were studied using unbiased DTT approaches designed for probing unknown pathways, including whole-brain seeding and large pathway-selection volumes. Several quality-control steps verified the results. RESULTS: Parallel amygdalo-fusiform and hippocampo-fusiform pathways were found in all subjects. The pathways begin/end at the mid-fusiform gyrus above the lateral occipitotemporal sulcus bilaterally. The superior pathway ends/begins at the superolateral amygdala. The inferior pathway crosses medially and ends/begins at the hippocampal head. The pathways are left-lateralized, with consistently larger cross-sectional area, higher anisotropy, and lower minimum eigenvalue (D-min) on the left, where D-min assesses intrinsic cross-fiber diffusivity independent of curvature. CONCLUSION: A previously-undescribed pathway system interconnecting the mid-fusiform region with the amygdala/hippocampus has been revealed. This pathway system may be important for recognition, memory consolidation, and emotional modulation of face, object, and lexical information, which may be disrupted in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: AIM: Cognitive visual dysfunctions (CVDs) reflect an impairment of the capacity to process visual information. The question of whether CVDs might be classifiable according to the nature and distribution of the underlying brain damage is an intriguing one in child neuropsychology. METHOD: We studied 22 children born preterm (12 males, 10 females; mean age at examination 8y, range 6-15y; mean gestational age 30wks, range 28-36wks) with periventricular leukomalacia, spastic diplegia, normal intelligence (mean Full-scale IQ 84; mean Verbal IQ 97; mean Performance IQ 74), and normal visual acuity, focusing on higher visual functions. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) were analysed to establish the presence of lesions along the primary optic pathway, in the occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal regions. RESULTS: Most children displayed an uneven cognitive profile, with deficits in visual object recognition, visual imagery, visual-spatial skills, and visual memory, and sparing of visual associative abilities, non-verbal intelligence, and face and letter recognition. Conventional brain MRI did not document major alterations of parietal and temporal white matter, or cortical alteration of areas involved in visual associative functions. INTERPRETATION: We suggest a widespread involvement of higher visual processing systems, involving both the ventral and dorsal streams, in preterm children with periventricular leukomalacia. The lack of major alterations on conventional MRI does not exclude the possibility of malfunctioning of higher visual processing systems, expressing itself through discrete CVDs. Possible mechanisms underlying these neuropsychological deficits are discussed.

Abstract: A 24-year-old male underwent awake surgery for a lesion in the left dominant basal temporo-occipital junction. During the intraoperative functional mapping using picture naming, cortical stimulation near the visual word form area led to visual paraphasia. These visual paraphasias were also elicited axonally by subcortical stimulation at the anterior wall of the cavity. We propose to discuss the existence of this "visual object form area", devoted to the visual recognition of object, and its links with the closely related "visual word form area". We suggest that its afference, whose stimulation also induced visual paraphasias, may be one part of the U-shaped fibers distributed along the posterior part of the occipito-temporal connection system (inferior longitudinal fasciculus). Preservation of this white matter tract is essential for visual recognition. Thus, it should be mapped intraoperatively more systematically.

Abstract: In one popular account of the human visual system, two streams are distinguished, a ventral stream specialized for perception and a dorsal stream specialized for action. The skillful use of familiar tools, however, is likely to involve the cooperation of both streams. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned individuals while they viewed short movies of familiar tools being grasped in ways that were either consistent or inconsistent with how tools are typically grasped during use. Typical-for-use actions were predicted to preferentially activate parietal areas important for tool use. Instead, our results revealed several areas within the ventral stream, as well as the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, as preferentially active for our typical-for-use actions. We believe these findings reflect sensitivity to learned semantic associations and suggest a special role for these areas in representing object-specific actions. We hypothesize that during actual tool use a complex interplay between the two streams must take place, with ventral stream areas providing critical input as to how an object should be engaged in accordance with stored semantic knowledge.

Abstract: Neuropsychological and functional imaging studies have associated the conceptual processing of numbers with bilateral parietal regions (including intraparietal sulcus). However, the processes driving these effects remain unclear because both left and right posterior parietal regions are activated by many other conceptual, perceptual, attention, and response-selection processes. To dissociate parietal activation that is number-selective from parietal activation related to other stimulus or response-selection processes, we used fMRI to compare numbers and object names during exactly the same conceptual and perceptual tasks while factoring out activations correlating with response times. We found that right parietal activation was higher for conceptual decisions on numbers relative to the same tasks on object names, even when response time effects were fully factored out. In contrast, left parietal activation for numbers was equally involved in conceptual processing of object names. We suggest that left parietal activation for numbers reflects a range of processes, including the retrieval of learnt facts that are also involved in conceptual decisions on object names. In contrast, number selectivity in right parietal cortex reflects processes that are more involved in conceptual decisions on numbers than object names. Our results generate a new set of hypotheses that have implications for the design of future behavioral and functional imaging studies of patients with left and right parietal damage.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To develop and implement a method for improved cerebellar tissue classification on the MRI of brain by automatically isolating the cerebellum prior to segmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual fast spin echo (FSE) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were acquired on 18 normal volunteers on a 3 T Philips scanner. The cerebellum was isolated from the rest of the brain using a symmetric inverse consistent nonlinear registration of individual brain with the parcellated template. The cerebellum was then separated by masking the anatomical image with individual FLAIR images. Tissues in both the cerebellum and rest of the brain were separately classified using hidden Markov random field (HMRF), a parametric method, and then combined to obtain tissue classification of the whole brain. The proposed method for tissue classification on real MR brain images was evaluated subjectively by two experts. The segmentation results on Brainweb images with varying noise and intensity nonuniformity levels were quantitatively compared with the ground truth by computing the Dice similarity indices. RESULTS: The proposed method significantly improved the cerebellar tissue classification on all normal volunteers included in this study without compromising the classification in remaining part of the brain. The average similarity indices for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in the cerebellum are 89.81 (+/-2.34) and 93.04 (+/-2.41), demonstrating excellent performance of the proposed methodology. CONCLUSION: The proposed method significantly improved tissue classification in the cerebellum. The GM was overestimated when segmentation was performed on the whole brain as a single object.

Abstract: Most neuroimaging studies are performed using one imaging method only, either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), or magnetoencephalography (MEG). Information on both location and timing has been sought by recording fMRI and EEG, simultaneously, or MEG and fMRI in separate sessions. Such approaches assume similar active areas whether detected via hemodynamic or electrophysiological signatures. Direct comparisons, after independent analysis of data from each imaging modality, have been conducted primarily on low-level sensory processing. Here, we report MEG (timing and location) and fMRI (location) results in 11 subjects when they named pictures that depicted an action or an object. The experimental design was exactly the same for the two imaging modalities. The MEG data were analyzed with two standard approaches: a set of equivalent current dipoles and a distributed minimum norm estimate. The fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) data were subjected to the usual random-effect contrast analysis. At the group level, MEG and fMRI data showed fairly good convergence, with both overall activation patterns and task effects localizing to comparable cortical regions. There were some systematic discrepancies, however, and the correspondence was less compelling in the individual subjects. The present analysis should be helpful in reconciling results of fMRI and MEG studies on high-level cognitive functions.

Abstract: Visual processing of the three-dimensional (3D) shape of objects is important for object recognition as well as for the control of grasping. Single cell studies have revealed that many ventral premotor cortical (F5) neurons are selective for the shape of real-world objects--the so-called canonical neurons--but there is little experimental evidence for depth structure selectivity in frontal cortex. Here we used contrast-agent enhanced fMRI in the awake monkey to investigate 3D shape processing defined by binocular disparity. We targeted regions in the monkey brain more active for curved than flat, fronto-parallel 3D surfaces. In addition to AIP (Durand et al., 2007), we observed depth structure sensitivity from disparity in a small region of infero-temporal cortex, TEs, known to house higher order disparity selective neurons. Furthermore, within ventral premotor cortex, the most rostral sector of F5, area F5a, showed sensitivity for depth structure from disparity. Within this area, 2D shape sensitivity was also observed, suggesting that area F5a processes complete 3D shape and might thus reflect the activity of canonical neurons. In conclusion, our data point to a distributed functional network, including TEs, AIP and F5a, involved in the analysis of stereoscopic 3D shape information and its potential use in the visual control of grasping.

Abstract: Although previous studies have shown that Braille reading and other tactile discrimination tasks activate the visual cortex of blind and sighted people, it is not known whether this kind of crossmodal reorganization is influenced by retinotopic organization. We have addressed this question by studying "S," a visually impaired adult with the rare ability to read print visually and Braille by touch. S had normal visual development until 6 years of age, and thereafter severe acuity reduction due to corneal opacification, but no evidence of visual-field loss. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that, in S's early visual areas, tactile information processing activated what would be the foveal representation for normally sighted individuals, and visual information processing activated what would be the peripheral representation. Control experiments showed that this activation pattern was not due to visual imagery. S's high-level visual areas, which correspond to shape- and object-selective areas in normally sighted individuals, were activated by both visual and tactile stimuli. The retinotopically specific reorganization in early visual areas suggests an efficient redistribution of neural resources in the visual cortex.

Abstract: Active shape models (ASM) are widely employed for recognizing anatomic structures and for delineating them in medical images. In this paper, a novel strategy called oriented active shape models (OASM) is presented in an attempt to overcome the following five limitations of ASM: 1) lower delineation accuracy, 2) the requirement of a large number of landmarks, 3) sensitivity to search range, 4) sensitivity to initialization, and 5) inability to fully exploit the specific information present in the given image to be segmented. OASM effectively combines the rich statistical shape information embodied in ASM with the boundary orientedness property and the globally optimal delineation capability of the live wire methodology of boundary segmentation. The latter characteristics allow live wire to effectively separate an object boundary from other nonobject boundaries with similar properties especially when they come very close in the image domain. The approach leads to a two-level dynamic programming method, wherein the first level corresponds to boundary recognition and the second level corresponds to boundary delineation, and to an effective automatic initialization method. The method outputs a globally optimal boundary that agrees with the shape model if the recognition step is successful in bringing the model close to the boundary in the image. Extensive evaluation experiments have been conducted by utilizing 40 image (magnetic resonance and computed tomography) data sets in each of five different application areas for segmenting breast, liver, bones of the foot, and cervical vertebrae of the spine. Comparisons are made between OASM and ASM based on precision, accuracy, and efficiency of segmentation. Accuracy is assessed using both region-based false positive and false negative measures and boundary-based distance measures. The results indicate the following: 1) The accuracy of segmentation via OASM is considerably better than that of ASM; 2) The number of landmarks can be reduced by a factor of 3 in OASM over that in ASM; 3) OASM becomes largely independent of search range and initialization becomes automatic. All three benefits of OASM ensue mainly from the severe constraints brought in by the boundary-orientedness property of live wire and the globally optimal solution found by the 2-level dynamic programming algorithm.

Abstract: Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Cognitive deficits are a key feature of schizophrenia and a primary cause of long-term disability. Current neurophysiological models of schizophrenia focus on distributed brain dysfunction with bottom-up as well as top-down components. Bottom-up deficits in cognitive processing are driven by impairments in basic perceptual processes that localize to primary sensory brain regions. Within the auditory system, deficits are apparent in elemental sensory processing, such as tone matching following brief delay. Such deficits lead to impairments in higher-order processes such as phonological processing and auditory emotion recognition. Within the visual system, deficits are apparent in functioning of the magnocellular visual pathway, leading to higher-order deficits in processes such as perceptual closure, object recognition, and reading. In both auditory and visual systems, patterns of deficit are consistent with underlying impairment of brain N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor systems.

Abstract: The human visual pathways that are specialized for object recognition stretch from lateral occipital cortex (LO) to the ventral surface of the temporal lobe, including the fusiform gyrus. Plasticity in these pathways supports the acquisition of visual expertise, but precisely how training affects the different regions remains unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity in both LO and the fusiform gyrus in radiologists as they detected abnormalities in chest radiographs. Activity in the right fusiform face area (FFA) correlated with visual expertise, measured as behavioral performance during scanning. In contrast, activity in left LO correlated negatively with expertise, and the amount of LO that responded to radiographs was smaller in experts than in novices. Activity in the FFA and LO correlated negatively in experts, whereas in novices, the 2 regions showed no stable relationship. Together, these results suggest that the FFA becomes more engaged and left LO less engaged in interpreting radiographic images over the course of training. Achieving expert visual performance may involve suppressing existing neural representations while simultaneously developing others.

Task Performance and Analysis
Abstract: There are several models of premotor cortex contributions to sensorimotor behavior. For instance, the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) appears to be involved in processing visuospatial object properties for grasping, whereas the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is involved in using arbitrary rules to guide advance motor planning. These models have focused on individual movements. Here, we examine the premotor responses evoked during the processing of individual movements functionally embedded in an action. We tested whether processing hand-object interactions and action end states would differentially engage PMv and PMd. We used a repetition suppression (RS)-functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm in which we independently manipulated the observed grip, the end position of the object (independent of its spatial location), and the hand trajectory. By comparing novel and repeated trials for each of these action components, we could isolate RS effects specific to each of them. Repeating the grasp component attenuated activity in right PMv, whereas repeating the end state of the action reduced blood oxygen level-dependent activity in the left PMd. These results suggest that PMv is involved in controlling the kinematic means of an appropriate hand-object interaction, whereas PMd is focused on specifying the desired end state of an action.

Abstract: For surgical planning in spine surgery, the segmentation of anatomical structures is a prerequisite. Past efforts focussed on the segmentation of vertebrae from tomographic data, but soft tissue structures have, for the most part, been neglected. Only sparse research work has been done for the spinal cord and the trachea. However, as far as the author is aware, there is no work on segmenting intervertebral discs. Therefore, a totally automatic reconstruction algorithm for the most relevant cervical structures is presented. It is implemented as a straightforward process, using anatomical knowledge which is, in concept, transferrable to other tissues of the human body. No seed points are required since the discs, as initial landmarks, are located via an object recognition approach. The spinal musculature is reconstructed by surface analysis on already segmented vertebrae, thus it can be taken into account in a biomechanical simulation. The segmentation results of our approach showed 91% accordance with expert segmentations and the computation time is less than 1 min on a standard PC. Since the presented system follows some general concepts this approach may also be considered as a step towards full body segmentation of the human.

Abstract: In the human brain, a network of frontal and parietal regions is commonly recruited during tasks that demand the deliberate, focused control of thought and action. Previously, using a simple target detection task, we reported striking differences in the selectivity of the BOLD response in anatomically distinct subregions of this network. In particular, it was observed that the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) followed a tightly tuned function, selectively responding only to the current target object. Here, we examine this functional specialization further, using adapted versions of our original task. Our results demonstrate that the response of the right IFG to targets is a strong and replicable phenomenon. It occurs under increased attentional load, when targets and distractors are equally frequent, and when controlling for inhibitory processes. These findings support the hypothesis that the right IFG responds selectively to those items that are of the most relevance to the currently intended task schema.

Abstract: This study examined the neural basis underlying the sequential involvement of sentence processing and determined the point at which the processing cost for an object-initial sentence was observed. We presented each phrase in a Japanese object-initial sentence to Japanese participants one by one using an event-related functional MRI technique and compared with our previous subject-initial experiment. We found that the left lingual gyrus was activated upon presentation of the first noun phrases, and the left inferior frontal gyrus upon presentation of the second noun phrases. The processing cost for an object-initial sentence was observed during verb recognition. Our results suggest that the syntactic complexity of an object-initial sentence is processed by the human brain upon verb recognition.

Abstract: OBJECT: Nerve regeneration could be monitored by comparing MRI image intensities in time, as denervated muscles display increased signal intensity in STIR sequences. In this study long-term reproducibility of STIR image intensity was assessed under clinical conditions and the required image intensity nonuniformity correction was improved by using phantom scans obtained at multiple positions. METHODS: Three-dimensional image intensity nonuniformity was investigated in phantom scans. Next, over a three-year period, 190 clinical STIR hand scans were obtained using a standardized acquisition protocol, and corrected for intensity nonuniformity by using the results of phantom scanning. The results of correction with 1, 3, and 11 phantom scans were compared. The image intensities in calibration tubes close to the hands were measured every time to determine the reproducibility of our method. RESULTS: With calibration, the reproducibility of STIR image intensity improved from 7.8 to 6.4%. Image intensity nonuniformity correction with 11 phantom scans gave significantly better results than correction with 1 or 3 scans. CONCLUSIONS: The image intensities in clinical STIR images acquired at different times can be compared directly, provided that the acquisition protocol is standardized and that nonuniformity correction is applied. Nonuniformity correction is preferably based on multiple phantom scans.

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that neural representations of semantic knowledge contain information about category, modality, and attributes. Although an object's category is defined according to shared attributes that uniquely distinguish it from other category members, a clear dissociation between visual attribute and category representation has not yet been reported. We investigated the contribution of category (living and nonliving) and visual attribute (global form and local details) to semantic representation in the fusiform gyrus. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 40 adults named pictures of animals, tools, and vehicles. In a preliminary study, identification of objects in these categories was differentially dependent on global versus local visual feature processing. fMRI findings indicate that activation in the lateral and medial regions of the fusiform gyrus distinguished stimuli according to category, that is, living versus nonliving, respectively. In contrast, visual attributes of global form (animals) were associated with higher activity in the right fusiform gyrus, while local details (tools) were associated with higher activity in the left fusiform gyrus. When both global and local attributes were relevant to processing (vehicles), cortex in both left and right medial fusiform gyri was more active than for other categories. Taken together, results support distinctions in the role of visual attributes and category in semantic representation.

Abstract: When we view visual images in everyday life, our perception is oriented toward object identification. In contrast, when viewing visual images as artworks, we also tend to experience subjective reactions to their stylistic and structural properties. This experiment sought to determine how cognitive control and perceptual facilitation contribute to aesthetic perception along with the experience of emotion. Using functional MRI, we show that aesthetic perception activated bilateral insula which we attribute to the experience of emotion. Moreover, while adopting the aesthetic orientation activated the left lateral prefrontal cortex, paintings that facilitated visuospatial exploration activated the left superior parietal lobule. The results suggest that aesthetic experience is a function of the interaction between top-down orienting of attention and bottom-up perceptual facilitation.

Abstract: How does the brain bind together the different sensory features of objects to form meaningful, multimodal object representations? Human functional imaging findings implicate the left posterior superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus (pSTS/MTG) in crossmodal integration, while animal ablation findings support a hierarchical object processing model in which outputs from each sensory stream are integrated in perirhinal cortex (PRc) of the anteromedial temporal lobe. To determine which neural regions are necessary for integrating audiovisual object features, and which regions are necessary for understanding the meaning of crossmodal objects, we administered crossmodal (audio-visual) and unimodal (auditory, visual) integration tasks to 16 brain-damaged patients. We correlated patients' behavioural performance with measures of neural integrity (signal intensity) of each voxel across the brains of each patient. The integrity of bilateral anteromedial and temporopolar regions, but not pSTS/MTG, was significantly correlated with poorer crossmodal compared with unimodal integration performance, and with meaningful aspects of crossmodal integration. Additional analyses confirmed the negative crossmodal integration findings in the pSTS/MTG: performance on a sentence-picture matching control task was significantly correlated with MTG/STG voxel signal intensities, suggesting that a truncated range of signals in this region could not have been responsible for the lack of a significant correlation between integrity and crossmodal integration performance, and individual analyses of three patients with lesions in pSTS/MTG but spared anteromedial temporal cortex revealed equivalent unimodal and crossmodal integration performance. These results extend findings from the non-human primate literature into the human domain by demonstrating that anteromedial temporal cortex is critically involved in crossmodal integration of object features. However, pSTS/MTG appears to play a supportive but non-essential role during crossmodal integration. Taken together, the present findings are consistent with a neurocognitive account of object representations which claims that anteromedial temporal lobe is critically involved in the formation and processing of complex, multimodal object representations.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that primate visual cortex has a specialized architecture for processing discrete object categories such as faces. Human fMRI studies have described a localized region in the fusiform gyrus [the fusiform face area (FFA)] that responds selectively to faces. In contrast, in nonhuman primates, electrophysiological and fMRI studies have instead revealed 2 apparently analogous regions of face representation: the posterior temporal face patch (PTFP) and the anterior temporal face patch (ATFP). An earlier study suggested that human FFA is homologous to the PTFP in macaque. However, in humans, no obvious homologue of the macaque ATFP has been demonstrated. Here, we used fMRI to map face-selective sites in both humans and macaques, based on equivalent stimuli in a quantitative topographic comparison. This fMRI evidence suggests that such a face-selective area exists in human anterior inferotemporal cortex, comprising the apparent homologue of the fMRI-defined ATFP in macaques.

Abstract: We investigated the relationship between stimulus similarity for a set of parameterized shapes and the spatial scale of neural representation within subregions of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) using a carryover functional magnetic resonance imaging design. In ventral but not lateral LOC, a linear recovery from adaptation proportional to shape dissimilarity was seen. In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape. The results, indicating a coarse spatial coding of shape features in lateral LOC and a more focused coding of the entire shape space within ventral LOC, may be related to hierarchical models of object processing.

Abstract: Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.

Abstract: Detection of edge contours to define the object class and segmenting it from the background(s) class is a major challenge in medical image processing. In this paper, we introduce a fast adaptive B-Spline Snake algorithm that overcomes the limitations of previous B-Snakes by avoiding computationally expensive optimization stages. Furthermore, we present novel strategies for adaptive knot insertion to fulfill the specific requirements of the medical application accordingly. Experimental results on pulmonary CT images and brain MR images demonstrated that our method is superior both in accuracy and convergence speed over previous B-Spline Snake algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also robust to missing the boundaries.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) shape is important for the visual control of grasping and manipulation and for object recognition. Although there has been some progress in our understanding of how 3D shape is extracted from motion and other monocular cues, little is known of how the human brain extracts 3D shape from disparity, commonly regarded as the strongest depth cue. Previous fMRI studies in the awake monkey have established that the interaction between stereo (present or absent) and the order of disparity (zero or second order) constitutes the MR signature of regions housing second-order disparity-selective neurons (Janssen et al., 2000; Srivastava et al., 2006; Durand et al., 2007; Joly et al., 2007). Testing the interaction between stereo and order of disparity in a large cohort of human subjects, revealed the involvement of five IPS regions (VIPS/V7*, POIPS, DIPSM, DIPSA, and phAIP), as well as V3 and the V3A complex in occipital cortex, the posterior inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and ventral premotor cortex (vPrCS) in the extraction and processing of 3D shape from stereo. Control experiments ruled out attention and convergence eye movements as confounding factors. Many of these regions, DIPSM, DIPSA, phAIP, and probably posterior ITG and ventral premotor cortex, correspond to monkey regions with similar functionality, whereas the evolutionarily new or modified regions are located in occipital (the V3A complex) and occipitoparietal cortex (VIPS/V7* and POIPS). Interestingly, activity in these occipital regions correlates with the depth amplitude perceived by the subjects in the 3D surfaces used as stimuli in these fMRI experiments.

Abstract: Simultanagnosia (resulting from occipito-parietal damage) is a profound visual deficit, which impairs the ability to perceive multiple items in a visual display, while preserving the ability to recognise single objects. Here we demonstrate in a patient presenting with Balint's syndrome that this deficit may result from an extreme form of competition between objects which makes it difficult for attention to be disengaged from an object once it has been selected.

Abstract: The present event-related fMRI study addressed the question whether retrieval-related neural activity in lateral parietal cortex is affected by the relative probability of test items. We varied the proportion of old to new items across two test blocks, with 25% of the items being old in one block and 75% being old in the other. Prior to each block, participants (N=18) completed one of two types of study judgment on each of 108 object images. They then performed a source memory test with four response options: studied in task 1, studied in task 2, old but unsure of the study task, and new. Retrieval-related activity in regions previously identified as recollection-sensitive, including the left inferior lateral parietal cortex and bilateral medial temporal cortex, was unaffected by old/new ratio. Generic retrieval success effects--retrieval-related effects common to recognized items attracting either a correct or an incorrect source judgment--were identified in several regions of left superior parietal cortex. These effects dissociated between a middle region of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), where activity did not interact with ratio, and regions anterior and posterior to the middle IPS where activity was sensitive to old/new ratio. The findings are inconsistent with prior proposals that retrieval-related activity in and around the left middle IPS reflects the relative salience of old and new test items. Rather, they suggest that, as in the case of more inferior left parietal regions, retrieval-related activity in this region reflects processes directly linked to retrieval.

Abstract: We investigated the coding of subordinate shape similarity in human object-selective cortex in two event-related functional magnetic resonance adaptation (fMR-A) experiments. Previous studies using faces have concluded that there is a narrow tuning of neuronal populations selective to each face, and that tuning is relative to the expected "average" face (norm-based encoding). Here we investigated these issues using outlines of animals and tools occupying a particular position on different morphing sequences per category. In a first experiment, we inferred the width of neural tuning to exemplars by examining whether the release from adaptation with increasing shape changes between two stimuli asymptotes. In a second experiment, we compared the response to central and extreme positions in shape space while controlling for the number of presentations of each unique stimulus to study whether the expected "average" category exemplar plays a role. The current fMR-A results show that a small change in exemplar shape produces a large release of adaptation, but only for outline shape changes of animals and not for man-made tools. Furthermore, our results suggested that central and extreme positions were not treated differently. Together, these results suggest a narrow tuning in object-selective cortex for individual exemplars from natural object categories, consistent with an exemplar-based encoding principle.

Abstract: When incompatible images are presented to the two eyes, one image can dominate awareness while the other is suppressed and invisible. We used high-resolution functional neuroimaging in humans to investigate the neural representation of such suppressed stimuli. Overall responses of high-level ventral visual areas to two different types of invisible object stimuli (faces and houses) were very weak and did not differ in amplitude. Despite this, fine-grained spatial activity patterns within these areas allowed us to predict significantly better than chance whether an observer was presented with face or house stimuli not only when these stimuli were visible but also when they were suppressed and entirely invisible. These findings demonstrate the presence of category-specific information in high-level visual areas during profound interocular suppression of object stimuli that can only be retrieved when the fine-scale pattern of activity within these areas is taken into account.

Abstract: Language perception comprises mechanisms of perception and discrimination of auditory stimuli. An important component of auditory perception and discrimination concerns auditory objects. Many interesting auditory objects in our environment are of relatively long duration; however, the temporal window of integration of auditory cortex neurons processing these objects is very limited. Thus, it is necessary to make active use of short-term memory in order to construct and temporarily store long-duration objects. We sought to understand the mechanisms by which the brain manipulates long-duration tonal patterns, temporarily stores the segments of those patterns, and integrates them into an auditory object. We extended a previously constructed model of auditory recognition of short-duration tonal patterns by expanding the prefrontal cortically-based short-term memory module of the previous model into a memory buffer with multiple short-term memory submodules and by adding a gating module. The gating module distributes the segments of the input pattern to separate locations of the extended prefrontal cortex in an orderly fashion, allowing a subsequent comparison of the stored segments against the segments of a second pattern. In addition to simulating behavioral data and electrical activity of neurons, our model also produces simulations of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal as obtained in fMRI studies. The results of these simulations provided us with predictions that we tested in an fMRI experiment with normal volunteers. This fMRI experiment used the same task and similar stimuli to that of the model. We compared simulated data with experimental values. We found that two brain areas, the right precentral gyrus and the left medial frontal gyrus, correlated well with our simulations of the memory gating module. Other fMRI studies of auditory perception and discrimination have also found correlation of fMRI activation of those areas with similar tasks and thus provide further support to our findings.

Abstract: Tactile agnosia has been described after lesions of the primary sensory cortex but the exact location and extension of those lesions is not clear. We report the clinical features and imaging findings in a patient with an acute ischemic stroke restricted to the primary sensory area (S1). A 73-year-old man had a sudden onset of a left alien hand, without left hemiparesis. Neurological examination showed intact primary sensory functions, but impaired recognition of shape, size (macrogeometrical) and texture (microgeometrical) of objects; damage confined to the post-central gyrus, sparing the posterior parietal cortex was demonstrated on MRI. An embolic occlusion of the anterior parietal artery was suspected as mechanism of stroke. Tactile agnosia with impaired microgeometrical and macrogeometrical features' recognition can result from a single lesion in the primary sensory cortex (S1) in the right parietal hemisphere, sparing other regions of the cerebral cortex which presumably participate in tactile object recognition.

Abstract: We have recently shown that intrinsic fluctuations of ongoing activity during baseline have an impact on perceptual decisions reported for an ambiguous visual stimulus (Hesselmann et al., 2008). To test whether this result generalizes from the visual object domain to other perceptual and neural systems, the current study investigated the effect of ongoing signal fluctuations in motion-sensitive brain regions on the perception of coherent visual motion. We determined motion coherence thresholds individually for each subject using a dynamic random dot display. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brief events of subliminal, supraliminal, and periliminal coherent motion were presented with long and variable interstimulus intervals between them. On each trial, subjects reported whether they had perceived "coherent" or "random" motion, and fMRI signal time courses were analyzed separately as a function of stimulus and percept type. In the right motion-sensitive occipito-temporal cortex (hMT+), coherent percepts of periliminal stimuli yielded a larger stimulus-evoked response than random percepts. Prestimulus baseline activity in this region was also significantly higher in these coherent trials than in random trials. As in our previous study, however, the relation between ongoing and evoked activity was not additive but interacted with perceptual outcome. Our data thus suggest that endogenous fluctuations in baseline activity have a generic effect on subsequent perceptual decisions. Although mainstream analytical techniques used in functional neuroimaging do not capture this nonadditive effect of baseline on evoked response, it is in accord with postulates from theoretical frameworks as, for instance, predictive coding.

Abstract: We propose a novel parametric deformable model controlled by shape and visual appearance priors learned from a training subset of co-aligned medical images of goal objects. The shape prior is derived from a linear combination of vectors of distances between the training boundaries and their common centroid. The appearance prior considers gray levels within each training boundary as a sample of a Markov-Gibbs random field with pairwise interaction. Spatially homogeneous interaction geometry and Gibbs potentials are analytically estimated from the training data. To accurately separate a goal object from an arbitrary background, empirical marginal gray level distributions inside and outside of the boundary are modeled with adaptive linear combinations of discrete Gaussians (LCDG). Due to the analytical shape and appearance priors and a simple Expectation-Maximization procedure for getting the object and background LCDG, our segmentation is considerably faster than with most of the known geometric and parametric models. Experiments with various goal images confirm the robustness, accuracy, and speed of our approach.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The variety of ways in which faces are categorized makes face recognition challenging for both synthetic and biological vision systems. Here we focus on two face processing tasks, detection and individuation, and explore whether differences in task demands lead to differences both in the features most effective for automatic recognition and in the featural codes recruited by neural processing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our study appeals to a computational framework characterizing the features representing object categories as sets of overlapping image fragments. Within this framework, we assess the extent to which task-relevant information differs across image fragments. Based on objective differences we find among task-specific representations, we test the sensitivity of the human visual system to these different face descriptions independently of one another. Both behavior and functional magnetic resonance imaging reveal effects elicited by objective task-specific levels of information. Behaviorally, recognition performance with image fragments improves with increasing task-specific information carried by different face fragments. Neurally, this sensitivity to the two tasks manifests as differential localization of neural responses across the ventral visual pathway. Fragments diagnostic for detection evoke larger neural responses than non-diagnostic ones in the right posterior fusiform gyrus and bilaterally in the inferior occipital gyrus. In contrast, fragments diagnostic for individuation evoke larger responses than non-diagnostic ones in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus. Finally, for individuation only, pattern analysis reveals sensitivity to task-specific information within the right "fusiform face area". CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE: 1) information diagnostic for face detection and individuation is roughly separable; 2) the human visual system is independently sensitive to both types of information; 3) neural responses differ according to the type of task-relevant information considered. More generally, these findings provide evidence for the computational utility and the neural validity of fragment-based visual representation and recognition.

Abstract: This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the mental simulation of drawing (1) investigated the neural substrates of drawing and (2) delineated the semantic aspects of drawing. The goal was to advance our understanding of how drawing a familiar object is linked to lexical semantics and therefore a viable method to use to rehabilitate aphasia. We hypothesized that the semantic aspects of drawing familiar objects compared to drawing non-objects would yield greater activation in the inferior temporal cortex and the inferior frontal cortex of the left hemisphere. To test this hypothesis, eight right-handed subjects performed an fMRI experiment that directly contrasted drawing familiar objects to non-objects using mental imagery. Simulated drawing recruited a large, distributed network of frontal, parietal, and temporal structures. In the contrast comparing drawing familiar objects to non-objects there was stronger activation in the left hemisphere within the inferior temporal, anterior inferior frontal, inferior parietal and superior frontal cortices. The activation within the inferior temporal cortex was associated with visual semantic processing and semantic mediated naming. We suggest that the anterior inferior frontal activation is linked to the inferior temporal cortex and is involved in the selection of specific semantic features of the object as well as retrieval of information regarding the perceptual aspects of the object.

Abstract: Inferior temporal (IT) object representations have been intensively studied in monkeys and humans, but representations of the same particular objects have never been compared between the species. Moreover, IT's role in categorization is not well understood. Here, we presented monkeys and humans with the same images of real-world objects and measured the IT response pattern elicited by each image. In order to relate the representations between the species and to computational models, we compare response-pattern dissimilarity matrices. IT response patterns form category clusters, which match between man and monkey. The clusters correspond to animate and inanimate objects; within the animate objects, faces and bodies form subclusters. Within each category, IT distinguishes individual exemplars, and the within-category exemplar similarities also match between the species. Our findings suggest that primate IT across species may host a common code, which combines a categorical and a continuous representation of objects.

Abstract: The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study provides direct evidence on visual object-category formation in the human brain. Although brain imaging has demonstrated object-category specific representations in the occipitotemporal cortex, the crucial question of how the brain acquires this knowledge has remained unresolved. We designed a stimulus set consisting of six highly similar bird types that can hardly be distinguished without training. All bird types were morphed with one another to create different exemplars of each category. After visual training, fMRI showed that responses in the right fusiform gyrus were larger for bird types for which a discrete category-boundary was established as compared with not-trained bird types. Importantly, compared with not-trained bird types, right fusiform responses were smaller for visually similar birds to which subjects were exposed during training but for which no category-boundary was learned. These data provide evidence for experience-induced shaping of occipitotemporal responses that are involved in category learning in the human brain.

Abstract: Understanding the nature of object representations in the human brain is critical for understanding the neural basis of invariant object recognition. However, the degree to which object representations are sensitive to object viewpoint is unknown. Using fMRI we employed a parametric approach to examine the sensitivity to object view as a function of rotation (0 degrees-180 degrees ), category (animal/vehicle) and fMRI-adaptation paradigm (short or long-lagged). For both categories and fMRI-adaptation paradigms, object-selective regions recovered from adaptation when a rotated view of an object was shown after adaptation to a specific view of that object, suggesting that representations are sensitive to object rotation. However, we found evidence for differential representations across categories and ventral stream regions. Rotation cross-adaptation was larger for animals than vehicles, suggesting higher sensitivity to vehicle than animal rotation, and was largest in the left fusiform/occipito-temporal sulcus (pFUS/OTS), suggesting that this region has low sensitivity to rotation. Moreover, right pFUS/OTS and FFA responded more strongly to front than back views of animals (without adaptation) and rotation cross-adaptation depended both on the level of rotation and the adapting view. This result suggests a prevalence of neurons that prefer frontal views of animals in fusiform regions. Using a computational model of view-tuned neurons, we demonstrate that differential neural view tuning widths and relative distributions of neural-tuned populations in fMRI voxels can explain the fMRI results. Overall, our findings underscore the utility of parametric approaches for studying the neural basis of object invariance and suggest that there is no complete invariance to object view in the human ventral stream.

Abstract: Visual form recognition is mediated by the ventral extrastriate processing stream. Some regions of ventral stream cortex show preferential activity for specific stimulus categories, but little is known about how this regional specialization develops. Acquisition of letter-naming skill is of particular interest because letter recognition serves as the gateway to visual processing of words, and fluent letter naming predicts children's reading success. For this reason, we examined the school-age development of visual letter processing using fMRI. In a 2 x 2 design, we compared ventral stream BOLD activity in two groups, children (n= 22, age 6-11) and adults (n= 15, age 20-22), during two tasks: naming of single letters and naming of simple line drawings of objects. We hypothesized that, based on adults' greater experience with letters, the posterior left fusiform gyrus would be activated more in adults for letter naming than it would be in children. We found that bilateral areas of ventral stream cortex during letter naming were activated in both children and adults and that the midposterior areas of the fusiform gyrus in both hemispheres were activated to a greater degree in adults than in children. There were no areas within the ventral stream in either hemisphere that were activated preferentially for letters over line drawings, nor were there any significant differences in the developmental changes observed for letter naming compared to object naming. These findings indicate that visual processing of single letters continues to develop in both hemispheres during grade school. However, we found no evidence for development of areas specialized for single letter processing. Rather, our findings suggest that letter recognition is performed using the same general form recognition systems as are used to process other visually similar stimuli.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that the neural processes associated with identifying everyday stimuli include the classification of those stimuli into a limited number of semantic categories. How the neural representations of these stimuli are organized in the temporal lobe remains under debate. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify correlates for three current hypotheses concerning object representations in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys and humans: representations based on animacy, semantic categories, or visual features. Subjects were presented with blocked images of faces, body parts (animate stimuli), objects, and places (inanimate stimuli), and multiple overlapping contrasts were used to identify the voxels most selective for each category. Stimulus representations appeared to segregate according to semantic relationships. Discrete regions selective for animate and inanimate stimuli were found in both species. These regions could be further subdivided into regions selective for individual categories. Notably, face-selective regions were contiguous with body-part-selective regions, and object-selective regions were contiguous with place-selective regions. When category-selective regions in monkeys were tested with blocks of single exemplars, individual voxels showed preferences for visually dissimilar exemplars from the same category and voxels with similar preferences tended to cluster together. Our results provide some novel observations with respect to how stimulus representations are organized in IT cortex. In addition, they further support the idea that representations of complex stimuli in IT cortex are organized into multiple hierarchical tiers, encompassing both semantic and physical properties.

Abstract: Stimulus reduction is an effective way to study visual performance. Cues such as surface characteristics, colour and inner lines can be removed from stimuli, revealing how the change affects recognition and neural processing. An extreme reduction is the removal of the very stimulus, defining it with illusory lines. Perceived boundaries without physical differences between shape and background are called illusory (or subjective) contours. Illusory and real contours activate early stages of the macaque visual pathway in similar ways. However, data relating to the processing of illusory contours in higher visual areas are scarce. We recently reported how illusory contours based on abutting-line gratings affect neurones in the monkey inferotemporal cortex, an area essential for object and shape vision. We now present data on how inferotemporal cortical neurones of monkeys react to another type of shapes, the Kanizsa figures. A set of line drawings, silhouettes, their illusory contour-based counterparts, and control shapes have been presented to awake, fixating rhesus monkeys while single-cell activity was recorded in the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex. Most of the recorded neurones were responsive and selective to shapes presented as illusory contours. Shape selectivity was proved to be different for line drawings and illusory contours, and also for silhouettes and illusory contours. Neuronal response latencies for Kanizsa figures were significantly longer than those for line drawings and silhouettes. These results reveal differences in processing for Kanizsa figures and shapes having real contours in the monkey inferotemporal cortex.

Abstract: A large body of research indicates a critical role for the left mid-fusiform cortex in reading, however, the extent to which this area is dedicated exclusively to the processing of words and letters has been debated. Two questions regarding left mid-fusiform function are critical to this debate: (1) Are letters stored preferentially compared to visually equivalent non-letters (letter selectivity)? (2) Are letter representations abstract with respect to changes in letter case (e.g., A/a; case invariance)? The present study addressed these questions by comparing priming for letters and pseudoletters in left and right mid-fusiform regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a same/different matching task. Results revealed priming for letters but not pseudoletters in the left mid-fusiform region, suggesting that representations are letter selective. However, no priming for different-case-primed letters was observed in this region, indicating that representations are not case invariant. In addition, priming for pseudoletters but not letters was observed in the homologous right mid-fusiform region. Overall, findings contradict strongly modular theories of letter/word processing and suggest that left and right mid-fusiform regions support generic object processes that are differentially effective for representing disparate types of visual stimuli.

Abstract: The integration of visual elements into global perception seems to be implemented separately to single object perception. This assumption is supported by the existence of patients with simultanagnosia who can identify single objects but are incapable of integrating multiple visual items. We investigated a case of simultanagnosia due to posterior cortical atrophy without structural brain damage who demonstrated an incomplete simultanagnosia. The patient successfully recognized a global stimulus in one trial but failed to do so just a few seconds later. Using event-related fMRI, we contrasted post hoc selected trials of successful global perception with trials of global recognition failure. We found circumscribed clusters of activity at the right and left primary intermediate sulci and a bilateral cluster at the ventral precuneus. The integration of multiple visual elements resulting in a conscious perception of their gestalt seems to rely on these bilateral structures in the human lateral and medial inferior parietal cortex.

Abstract: We investigated the relationship between experience-dependent eye movements, hippocampus-dependent memory, and aware memory. We measured eye movements in young adults, older adults, and memory-impaired patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe as they viewed 120 novel scenes and 120 previously viewed scenes. Participants indicated if each scene was old or new and also gave a confidence rating for the memory judgment. Young adults and older adults explored old scenes less than they explored new scenes, but the patients did not. For the young and older adults, this effect was observed only when participants were aware of the scene's familiar or novel status. In a second experiment, young adults viewed scenes that were either new, had been viewed previously, or had been viewed previously but had been changed (i.e., an object within the scene was either added or removed). The only instructions were to pay attention to the scenes and view each scene as it appeared, and there was no expectation that memory would be tested. Directly after the first altered scene was presented, participants were asked to classify the scene as new, old, or old but changed. Participants who were aware of the manipulation preferentially viewed the changed region, but participants who were unaware did not. These findings suggest that experience-dependent eye movements reflect hippocampus-dependent (and aware) memory, even when participants have no expectation that memory is being tested; and they are consistent with the view that awareness of what is learned is a fundamental characteristic of hippocampus-dependent memory.

Abstract: How representations of visual objects are maintained across changes in viewpoint is a central issue in visual perception. Whether neural processes underlying view-invariant recognition involve distinct subregions within extrastriate visual cortex for distinct categories of visual objects remains unresolved. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging in 16 healthy volunteers to map visual cortical areas responding to a large set (156) of exemplars from 3 object categories (faces, houses, and chairs), each repeated once after a variable time lag (3-7 intervening stimuli). Exemplars were repeated with the same viewpoint (but different retinal size) or with different viewpoint and size. The task was kept constant across object categories (judging items as "young" vs. "old"). We identified object-selective adaptation effects by comparing neural responses to the first presentation versus repetition of each individual exemplar. We found that exemplar-specific adaptation effects partly overlapped with regions showing category-selective responses (as identified using a separate localizer scan). These included the lateral fusiform gyrus (FG) for faces, parahippocampal gyrus for houses, and lateral occipital complex (LOC) for chairs. In face-selective fusiform gyrus (FG), adaptation effects occurred only for faces repeated with the same viewpoint, but not with a different viewpoint, confirming previous studies using faces only. By contrast, a region in right medial FG, adjacent to but nonoverlapping with the more lateral and face-selective FG, showed repetition effects for faces and to a lesser extent for other objects, regardless of changes in viewpoint or in retinal image-size. Category- and viewpoint-independent repetition effects were also found in bilateral LOC. Our results reveal a common neural substrate in bilateral LOC and right medial FG underlying view-invariant and category-independent recognition for multiple object identities, with only a relative preference for faces in medial FG but no selectivity in LOC.

Abstract: The spatial organization of the brain's object and face representations in the temporal lobe is critical for understanding high-level vision and cognition but is poorly understood. Recently, exciting progress has been made using advanced imaging and physiology methods in humans and nonhuman primates, and the combination of such methods may be particularly powerful. Studies applying these methods help us to understand how neuronal activity, optical imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are related within the temporal lobe, and to uncover the fine-grained and large-scale spatial organization of object and face representations in the primate brain.

Abstract: The medial temporal lobe cortex (MTLC) occupies a pivotal position at the interface between neocortical association areas and the hippocampus. It has been suggested that the MTLC contains functionally distinct regions, with perirhinal cortex (PRc) preferentially supporting object processing and posterior parahippocampal cortex (PHc) preferentially supporting encoding of spatial information. Measuring differential BOLD responsiveness to objects, scenes, and other stimulus categories, we find a double dissociation between an anterior PRc response to objects and a posterior PHc response to scene stimuli. Furthermore, an anatomical ROI based approach was undertaken in an effort to understand the response profile underlying this double dissociation. We did not see any evidence for a sharp border between putatively distinct scene-preferential and object-preferential MTLC regions. Instead, scene-preferential responsiveness was noted to drop off in a graded, linear fashion in successively anterior MTLC regions until object-preferential responsiveness emerged in anterior PRc, although objects produced above baseline responses across the anterior-posterior extent of the parahippocampal gyrus. Other stimulus categories, such as faces and words, led to above baseline activation in either a few confined regions (faces) or none at all (words). Thus, what differentiated regions along the parahippocampal gryus was the relative response to objects and scenes, not simply above baseline responses to either category. This pattern raises the possibility that posterior PHc, and anterior PRc are situated at the ends of a single organizational continuum supported by the entire length of MTLC.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for multi-object segmentation of deep brain structures, which have significant shape variations and relatively small sizes in medical brain images. In the images, the structure boundaries may be blurry or even missing, and the surrounding background is a clutter and full of irrelevant edges. We suggest a template-based framework, which fuses the information of edge features, region statistics and inter-structure constraints to detect and locate all the targeted brain structures such that manual initialization is unnecessary. The multi-object template is organized in the form of a hierarchical Markov dependence tree. It makes the matching of multiple objects efficient. Our approach needs only one example as training data and alleviates the demand of a large training set. The obtained segmentation results on real data are encouraging and the proposed method enjoys several important advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Richly labeled images representing several sub-structures of an organ occur quite frequently in medical images. For example, a typical brain image can be labeled into grey matter, white matter or cerebrospinal fluid, each of which may be subdivided further. Many manipulations such as interpolation, transformation, smoothing, or registration need to be performed on these images before they can be used in further analysis. In this work, we present a novel multi-shape representation and compare it with the existing representations to demonstrate certain advantages of using the proposed scheme. Specifically, we propose label space, a representation that is both flexible and well suited for coupled multi-shape analysis. Under this framework, object labels are mapped to vertices of a regular simplex, e.g. the unit interval for two labels, a triangle for three labels, a tetrahedron for four labels, etc. This forms the basis of a convex linear structure with the property that all labels are equally spaced. We will demonstrate that this representation has several desirable properties: algebraic operations may be performed directly, label uncertainty is expressed equivalently as a weighted mixture of labels or in a probabilistic manner, and interpolation is unbiased toward any label or the background. In order to demonstrate these properties, we compare label space to signed distance maps as well as other implicit representations in tasks such as smoothing, interpolation, registration, and principal component analysis.

Abstract: In functional MRI, head motion may cause dynamic nonlinear field-inhomogeneity changes, especially with large out-of-plane rotations. This may lead to dynamic geometric distortion or blurring in the time series, which may reduce activation detection accuracy. The use of image registration to estimate dynamic field inhomogeneity maps from a static field map is not sufficient in the presence of such rotations. This paper introduces a retrospective approach to estimate magnetic susceptibility induced field maps of an object in motion, given a static susceptibility induced field map and the associated object motion parameters. It estimates a susceptibility map from a static field map using regularized image restoration techniques, and applies rigid body motion to the former. The dynamic field map is then computed using susceptibility voxel convolution. The method addresses field map changes due to out-of-plane rotations during time series acquisition and does not involve real time field map acquisitions.

Abstract: In this paper we present MANTRA (Multi-Attribute, Non-Initializing, Texture Reconstruction Based Active Shape Model) which incorporates a number of features that improve on the the popular Active Shape Model (ASM) algorithm. MANTRA has the following advantages over the traditional ASM model. (1) It does not rely on image intensity information alone, as it incorporates multiple statistical texture features for boundary detection. (2) Unlike traditional ASMs, MANTRA finds the border by maximizing a higher dimensional version of mutual information (MI) called combined MI (CMI), which is estimated from kNN entropic graphs. The use of CMI helps to overcome limitations of the Mahalanobis distance, and allows multiple texture features to be intelligently combined. (3) MANTRA does not rely on the mean pixel intensity values to find the border; instead, it reconstructs potential image patches, and the image patch with the best reconstruction based on CMI is considered the object border. Our algorithm was quantitatively evaluated against expert ground truth on almost 230 clinical images (128 1.5 Tesla (T) T2 weighted in vivo prostate magnetic resonance (MR) images, 78 dynamic contrast enhanced breast MR images, and 21 3T in vivo T1-weighted prostate MR images) via 6 different quantitative metrics. Results from the more difficult prostate segmentation task (in which a second expert only had a 0.850 mean overlap with the first expert) show that the traditional ASM method had a mean overlap of 0.668, while the MANTRA model had a mean overlap of 0.840.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for optimizing surface point correspondences for shape modeling of multiobject anatomy, or shape complexes. The proposed method is novel in that it optimizes correspondence positions in the full, joint shape space of the object complex. Researchers have previously only considered the correspondence problem separately for each structure, thus ignoring the interstructural shape correlations that are increasingly of interest in many clinical contexts, such as the study of the effects of disease on groups of neuroanatomical structures. The proposed method uses a nonparametric, dynamic particle system to simultaneously sample object surfaces and optimize correspondence point positions. This paper also suggests a principled approach to hypothesis testing using the Hotelling T2 test in the PCA space of the correspondence model, with a simulation-based choice of the number of PCA modes. We also consider statistical analysis of object poses. The modeling and analysis methods are illustrated on brain structure complexes from an ongoing clinical study of pediatric autism.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an improved region-based active contour/surface model for 2D/3D brain MR image segmentation. Our model combines the advantages of both local and global intensity information, which enable the model to cope with intensity inhomogeneity. We define an energy functional with a local intensity fitting term and an auxiliary global intensity fitting term. In the associated curve evolution, the motion of the contour is driven by a local intensity fitting force and a global intensity fitting force, induced by the local and global terms in the proposed energy functional, respectively. The influence of these two forces on the curve evolution is complementary. When the contour is close to object boundaries, the local intensity fitting force became dominant, which attracts the contour toward object boundaries and finally stops the contour there. The global intensity fitting force is dominant when the contour is far away from object boundaries, and it allows more flexible initialization of contours by using global image information. The proposed model has been applied to both 2D and 3D brain MR image segmentation with promising results.

Abstract: The mammalian visual system contains an extensive web of feedback connections projecting from higher cortical areas to lower areas, including primary visual cortex. Although multiple theories have been proposed, the role of these connections in perceptual processing is not understood. We found that the pattern of functional magnetic resonance imaging response in human foveal retinotopic cortex contained information about objects presented in the periphery, far away from the fovea, which has not been predicted by prior theories of feedback. This information was position invariant, correlated with perceptual discrimination accuracy and was found only in foveal, but not peripheral, retinotopic cortex. Our data cannot be explained by differential eye movements, activation from the fixation cross, or spillover activation from peripheral retinotopic cortex or from lateral occipital complex. Instead, our findings indicate that position-invariant object information from higher cortical areas is fed back to foveal retinotopic cortex, enhancing task performance.

Abstract: The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a region involved in audiovisual integration. In non-human primates, multisensory neurons in STS display inverse effectiveness. In two fMRI studies using multisensory tool and speech stimuli presented at parametrically varied levels of signal strength, we show that the pattern of neural activation in human STS is also inversely effective. Although multisensory tool-defined and speech-defined regions of interest were non-overlapping, the pattern of inverse effectiveness was the same for tools and speech across regions. The findings suggest that, even though there are sub-regions in STS that are speech-selective, the manner in which visual and auditory signals are integrated in multisensory STS is not specific to speech.

Abstract: We propose a principled framework for recursively segmenting deformable objects across a sequence of frames. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on left ventricular segmentation across a cardiac cycle. The approach involves a technique for learning the system dynamics together with methods of particle-based smoothing as well as nonparametric belief propagation on a loopy graphical model capturing the temporal periodicity of the heart. The dynamic system state is a low-dimensional representation of the boundary, and the boundary estimation involves incorporating curve evolution into recursive state estimation. By formulating the problem as one of state estimation, the segmentation at each particular time is based not only on the data observed at that instant, but also on predictions based on past and future boundary estimates. Although this paper focuses on left ventricle segmentation, the method generalizes to temporally segmenting any deformable object.

Abstract: In this work, we address an important but unexplored topic, namely the neural correlates of hate. In a block-design fMRI study, we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings. A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between-subject random effects analysis. Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in premotor cortex, in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula. We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred, the right insula, right premotor cortex and the right fronto-medial gyrus. One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus. The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love, this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter, namely the putamen and the insula.

Abstract: Schizophrenia patients exhibit deficits in various stages of visual information processing. Despite recent informative efforts to examine visual processing in schizophrenia with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), much remains unknown about the basic function, structure, and organization of key early visual processing areas in schizophrenia. This study examined magnitude and topography of regional brain activity in three early visual processing areas: early retinotopically organized areas (V1-V4), motion-sensitive areas (human area MT, hMT+), and object-recognition areas (lateral occipital complex, LO). Using visual stimuli that are known to preferentially activate each respective region, we compared responses in these areas in 22 schizophrenia patients and 19 normal controls. Activity in all three regions was of similar amplitude in schizophrenia patients and normal controls. Activity in retinotopically organized areas and hMT+ showed good spatial overlap between groups. However, activation of LO was more widely distributed in patients compared with normal controls. The findings of abnormal spatial organization of LO in schizophrenia patients may converge with behavioral evidence of deficits in schizophrenia patients for object-recognition tasks that are believed to be mediated by LO activity.

Abstract: OBJECT: It has been hypothesized that specific brain regions involved in face naming may exist in the brain. To spare these areas and to gain a better understanding of their organization, the authors studied patients who underwent surgery by using direct electrical stimulation mapping for brain tumors, and they compared an object-naming task to a famous face-naming task. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with brain tumors (39 and 17 in the left and right hemispheres, respectively) and with no significant preoperative overall language deficit were prospectively studied over a 2-year period. Four patients who had a partially selective famous face anomia and 2 with prosopagnosia were not included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Face-naming interferences were exclusively localized in small cortical areas (< 1 cm2). Among 35 patients whose dominant left hemisphere was studied, 26 face-naming specific areas (that is, sites of interference in face naming only and not in object naming) were found. These face naming-specific sites were significantly detected in 2 regions: in the left frontal areas of the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri (p < 0.001) and in the anterior part of the superior and middle temporal gyri (p < 0.01). Variable patterns of interference were observed (speech arrest, anomia, phonemic, or semantic paraphasia) probably related to the different stages in famous face processing. Only 4 famous face-naming interferences were found in the right hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Relative anatomical segregation of naming categories within language areas was detected. This study showed that famous face naming was preferentially processed in the left frontal and anterior temporal gyri. The authors think it is necessary to adapt naming tasks in neurosurgical patients to the brain region studied.

Abstract: The visual system processes object properties and spatial properties in distinct subsystems, and we hypothesized that this distinction might extend to individual differences in visual processing. We conducted a functional MRI study investigating the neural underpinnings of individual differences in object versus spatial visual processing. Nine participants of high object-processing ability ('object' visualizers) and eight participants of high spatial-processing ability ('spatial' visualizers) were scanned, while they performed an object-processing task. Object visualizers showed lower bilateral neural activity in lateral occipital complex and lower right-lateralized neural activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The data indicate that high object-processing ability is associated with more efficient use of visual-object resources, resulting in less neural activity in the object-processing pathway.

Abstract: Humans rely heavily on shape similarity among objects for object categorization and identification. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that a large region in human occipitotemporal cortex processes the shape of meaningful as well as unfamiliar objects. Here, we investigate whether the functional organization of this region as measured with fMRI is related to perceived shape similarity. We found that unfamiliar object classes that are rated as having a similar shape were associated with a very similar response pattern distributed across object-selective cortex, whereas object classes that were rated as being very different in shape were associated with a more different response pattern. Human observers, as well as object-selective cortex, were very sensitive to differences in shape features of the objects such as straight versus curved versus "spiky" edges, more so than to differences in overall shape envelope. Response patterns in retinotopic areas V1, V2, and V4 were not found to be related to perceived shape. The functional organization in area V3 was partially related to perceived shape but without a stronger sensitivity for shape features relative to overall shape envelope. Thus, for unfamiliar objects, the organization of human object-selective cortex is strongly related to perceived shape, and this shape-based organization emerges gradually throughout the object vision pathway.

Abstract: Humans can recognize common objects by touch extremely well whenever vision is unavailable. Despite its importance to a thorough understanding of human object recognition, the neuroscientific study of this topic has been relatively neglected. To date, the few published studies have addressed the haptic recognition of nonbiological objects. We now focus on haptic recognition of the human body, a particularly salient object category for touch. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that regions of the occipito-temporal cortex are specialized for visual perception of faces (fusiform face area, FFA) and other body parts (extrastriate body area, EBA). Are the same category-sensitive regions activated when these components of the body are recognized haptically? Here, we use fMRI to compare brain organization for haptic and visual recognition of human body parts. Sixteen subjects identified exemplars of faces, hands, feet, and nonbiological control objects using vision and haptics separately. We identified two discrete regions within the fusiform gyrus (FFA and the haptic face region) that were each sensitive to both haptically and visually presented faces; however, these two regions differed significantly in their response patterns. Similarly, two regions within the lateral occipito-temporal area (EBA and the haptic body region) were each sensitive to body parts in both modalities, although the response patterns differed. Thus, although the fusiform gyrus and the lateral occipito-temporal cortex appear to exhibit modality-independent, category-sensitive activity, our results also indicate a degree of functional specialization related to sensory modality within these structures.

Abstract: Previous behavioral studies reported a robust effect of increased naming latencies when objects to be named were blocked within semantic category, compared to items blocked between category. This semantic context effect has been attributed to various mechanisms including inhibition or excitation of lexico-semantic representations and incremental learning of associations between semantic features and names, and is hypothesized to increase demands on verbal self-monitoring during speech production. Objects within categories also share many visual structural features, introducing a potential confound when interpreting the level at which the context effect might occur. Consistent with previous findings, we report a significant increase in response latencies when naming categorically related objects within blocks, an effect associated with increased perfusion fMRI signal bilaterally in the hippocampus and in the left middle to posterior superior temporal cortex. No perfusion changes were observed in the middle section of the left middle temporal cortex, a region associated with retrieval of lexical-semantic information in previous object naming studies. Although a manipulation of visual feature similarity did not influence naming latencies, we observed perfusion increases in the perirhinal cortex for naming objects with similar visual features that interacted with the semantic context in which objects were named. These results provide support for the view that the semantic context effect in object naming occurs due to an incremental learning mechanism, and involves increased demands on verbal self-monitoring.

Abstract: Most experiments on the "neural correlates of consciousness" employ stimulus reportability as an operational definition of what is consciously perceived. The interpretation of such experiments therefore depends critically on understanding the neural basis of stimulus reportability. Using a high volume of fMRI data, we investigated the neural correlates of stimulus reportability using a partial report object detection paradigm. Subjects were presented with a random array of circularly arranged disc-stimuli and were cued, after variable delays (following stimulus offset), to report the presence or absence of a disc at the cued location, using variable motor actions. By uncoupling stimulus processing, decision, and motor response, we were able to use signal detection theory to deconstruct the neural basis of stimulus reportability. We show that retinotopically specific responses in the early visual cortex correlate with stimulus processing but not decision or report; a network of parietal/temporal regions correlates with decisions but not stimulus presence, whereas classical motor regions correlate with report. These findings provide a basic framework for understanding the neural basis of stimulus reportability without the theoretical burden of presupposing a relationship between reportability and consciousness.

Abstract: Our environment contains regularities distributed in space and time that can be detected by way of statistical learning. This unsupervised learning occurs without intent or awareness, but little is known about how it relates to other types of learning, how it affects perceptual processing, and how quickly it can occur. Here we use fMRI during statistical learning to explore these questions. Participants viewed statistically structured versus unstructured sequences of shapes while performing a task unrelated to the structure. Robust neural responses to statistical structure were observed, and these responses were notable in four ways: First, responses to structure were observed in the striatum and medial temporal lobe, suggesting that statistical learning may be related to other forms of associative learning and relational memory. Second, statistical regularities yielded greater activation in category-specific visual regions (object-selective lateral occipital cortex and word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex), demonstrating that these regions are sensitive to information distributed in time. Third, evidence of learning emerged early during familiarization, showing that statistical learning can operate very quickly and with little exposure. Finally, neural signatures of learning were dissociable from subsequent explicit familiarity, suggesting that learning can occur in the absence of awareness. Overall, our findings help elucidate the underlying nature of statistical learning.

Abstract: We recently demonstrated that attending to the form of objects and attending to their surface properties activated anatomically distinct regions of occipito-temporal cortex (Cant and Goodale, Cereb Cortex 17:713-731, 2007). Specifically, attending to form activated the lateral occipital area (LO), whereas attending to texture activated the collateral sulcus (CoS). Although these regions showed preferential activation to one particular stimulus dimension (e.g. texture in CoS), they also showed activation to other, non-preferred stimulus dimensions (e.g. form in CoS). This raises the question as to whether the activation associated with attention to form in CoS, for example, represents the actual processing of object form or instead represents the obligatory processing of object texture that occurred when people attended to form. To investigate this, we conducted an fMR-adaptation experiment which allowed us to examine the response properties of regions specialized for processing form, texture, and colour when participants were not explicitly attending to a particular stimulus dimension. Participants passively viewed blocks where only one dimension varied and blocks where no dimensions varied, while fixating a cross in the centre of the display. Area LO was most sensitive to variations in form, whereas the CoS was most sensitive to variations in texture. As in our previous study, no regions were found that were most sensitive to variations in colour, but unlike the results from that study, medial regions of the ventral stream along the fusiform gyrus and CoS showed some selectivity to colour. Taken together, these results replicate the findings from our previous study and provide additional evidence for the existence of separate processing pathways for form and surface properties (particularly texture) in the ventral stream.

Abstract: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Human emotional expressions serve an important communicatory role allowing the rapid transmission of valence information among individuals. We aimed at exploring the neural networks mediating the recognition of and empathy with human facial expressions of emotion. METHODS: A principal component analysis was applied to event-related functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) data of 14 right-handed healthy volunteers (29 +/- 6 years). During scanning, subjects viewed happy, sad and neutral face expressions in the following conditions: emotion recognition, empathizing with emotion, and a control condition of simple object detection. Functionally relevant principal components (PCs) were identified by planned comparisons at an alpha level of p < 0.001. RESULTS: Four PCs revealed significant differences in variance patterns of the conditions, thereby revealing distinct neural networks: mediating facial identification (PC 1), identification of an expressed emotion (PC 2), attention to an expressed emotion (PC 12), and sense of an emotional state (PC 27). CONCLUSION: Our findings further the notion that the appraisal of human facial expressions involves multiple neural circuits that process highly differentiated cognitive aspects of emotion.

Abstract: Many people experience transient difficulties in recognizing faces but only a small number of them cannot recognize their family members when meeting them unexpectedly. Such face blindness is associated with serious problems in everyday life. A better understanding of the neuro-functional basis of impaired face recognition may be achieved by a careful comparison with an equally unique object category and by a adding a more realistic setting involving neutral faces as well facial expressions. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuro-functional basis of perceiving faces and bodies in three developmental prosopagnosics (DP) and matched healthy controls. Our approach involved materials consisting of neutral faces and bodies as well as faces and bodies expressing fear or happiness. The first main result is that the presence of emotional information has a different effect in the patient vs. the control group in the fusiform face area (FFA). Neutral faces trigger lower activation in the DP group, compared to the control group, while activation for facial expressions is the same in both groups. The second main result is that compared to controls, DPs have increased activation for bodies in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and for neutral faces in the extrastriate body area (EBA), indicating that body and face sensitive processes are less categorically segregated in DP. Taken together our study shows the importance of using naturalistic emotional stimuli for a better understanding of developmental face deficits.

Abstract: This paper investigates how neuronal activation for naming photographs of objects is influenced by the addition of appropriate colour or sound. Behaviourally, both colour and sound are known to facilitate object recognition from visual form. However, previous functional imaging studies have shown inconsistent effects. For example, the addition of appropriate colour has been shown to reduce antero-medial temporal activation whereas the addition of sound has been shown to increase posterior superior temporal activation. Here we compared the effect of adding colour or sound cues in the same experiment. We found that the addition of either the appropriate colour or sound increased activation for naming photographs of objects in bilateral occipital regions and the right anterior fusiform. Moreover, the addition of colour reduced left antero-medial temporal activation but this effect was not observed for the addition of object sound. We propose that activation in bilateral occipital and right fusiform areas precedes the integration of visual form with either its colour or associated sound. In contrast, left antero-medial temporal activation is reduced because object recognition is facilitated after colour and form have been integrated.

Abstract: Neurons in the temporal lobe of both monkeys and humans show selective responses to classes of visual stimuli and even to specific individuals. In this study, we investigate the latency and selectivity of visually responsive neurons recorded from microelectrodes in the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala of human subjects during a visual object presentation task. During 96 experimental sessions in 35 subjects, we recorded from a total of 3278 neurons. Of these units, 398 responded selectively to one or more of the presented stimuli. Mean response latencies were substantially larger than those reported in monkeys. We observed a highly significant correlation between the latency and the selectivity of these neurons: the longer the latency the greater the selectivity. Particularly, parahippocampal neurons were found to respond significantly earlier and less selectively than those in the other three regions. Regional analysis showed significant correlations between latency and selectivity within the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, but not within the amygdala. The later and more selective responses tended to be generated by cells with sparse baseline firing rates and vice versa. Our results provide direct evidence for hierarchical processing of sensory information at the interface between the visual pathway and the limbic system, by which increasingly refined and specific representations of stimulus identity are generated over time along the anatomic pathways of the medial temporal lobe.

Abstract: We tested whether the control of real actions in an ever-changing environment would show any dependence on prior actions elicited by instructional cues a few seconds before. To this end, adaptation of the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal was measured while human participants sequentially grasped three-dimensional objects in an event-related design, using grasps oriented along the same or a different axis of either the same or a different object shape. We found that the bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus, an area previously linked to the control of visually guided grasping, along with other areas of the intraparietal sulcus, the left supramarginal gyrus, and the right mid superior parietal lobe showed clear adaptation following both repeated grasps and repeated objects. In contrast, the left ventral premotor cortex and the bilateral dorsal premotor cortex, the two premotor areas often linked to response selection, action planning, and execution, showed only grasp-selective adaptation. These results suggest that, even in real action guidance, parietofrontal areas demonstrate differential involvement in visuomotor processing dependent on whether the action or the object has been previously experienced.

Semantics
Abstract: One of the most provocative and exciting issues in cognitive science is how neural specificity for semantic categories of common objects arises in the functional architecture of the brain. More than two decades of research on the neuropsychological phenomenon of category-specific semantic deficits has generated detailed claims about the organization and representation of conceptual knowledge. More recently, researchers have sought to test hypotheses developed on the basis of neuropsychological evidence with functional imaging. From those two fields, the empirical generalization emerges that object domain and sensory modality jointly constrain the organization of knowledge in the brain. At the same time, research within the embodied cognition framework has highlighted the need to articulate how information is communicated between the sensory and motor systems, and processes that represent and generalize abstract information. Those developments point toward a new approach for understanding category specificity in terms of the coordinated influences of diverse regions and cognitive systems.

Abstract: Numerous neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have highlighted the role of the ventral, occipitotemporal visual processing stream in the representation and retrieval of semantic memory for the appearance of objects. Here, we examine the role of the parietal cortex in retrieval of object shape information. fMRI data were acquired as subjects listened to the names of common objects and made judgments about their shape. Recruitment of the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) during shape retrieval was modulated by the amount of prior tactile experience associated with the objects. In addition, the same pattern of activity was observed in right postcentral gyrus, suggesting that the representation of object shape is distributed amongst regions that are relevant to the sensorimotor acquisition history of this attribute, as predicted by distributed models of semantic memory.

Abstract: There is substantial evidence that object representations in adults are dynamically updated by learning. However, it is not clear to what extent these effects are induced by active processing of visual objects in a particular task context on top of the effects of mere exposure to the same objects. Here we show that the task does matter. We performed an event-related fMRI adaptation study in which we derived neural selectivity from a release of adaptation. We had two training conditions: "categorized objects" were categorized at a subordinate level based on fine shape differences (Which type of fish is this?), whereas "control objects" were seen equally often in a task context requiring no subordinate categorization (Is this a vase or not?). After training, the object-selective cortex was more selective for differences among categorized objects than for differences among control objects. This result indicates that the task context during training modulates the extent to which object selectivity is enhanced as a result of training.

Abstract: Pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. For example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [Science 293:5539 (2001) 2425-2430]. Many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fMRI data with varying degrees of success [Nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523-534]. In this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), using data collected at high field (7 Tesla) with higher resolution than usual fMRI studies. We investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. The performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. An important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.

Abstract: Our experience with a dynamic environment has tuned our visual system to use form and motion as complementary sources of information for object recognition. To identify the neural systems involved in integrating form and motion information during dynamic object processing, we used an fMRI adaptation paradigm which factorially manipulated form and motion repetition. Observers were sequentially presented with pairs of rotating novel objects in which the form or rotation direction in depth could be repeated. They were required to discriminate either dimension of the second target object, while the first object served as a form and/or motion prime. At the behavioural level, observers were faster to recognize the target or discriminate its direction when primed by the same form. Importantly, this form priming effect was enhanced when prime and target objects rotated in the same direction. At the neural level, the two priming effects (i.e., the main effect of form repetition and the interaction between form and motion repetition) were associated with reduced activations in distinct brain regions. Bilateral lateral occipital regions exhibited reduced activation when form was repeated irrespective of rotation direction. In contrast, bilateral anterior fusiform and posterior middle temporal regions (overlapping with hMT+/V5) regions showed an adaptation effect that depended on both form and motion direction. Thus, the current results reveal a visual processing hierarchy with lateral occipito-temporal cortex representing an object's 3D structure, and anterior fusiform and posterior middle temporal regions being involved in spatio-temporal integration of form and motion during dynamic object processing.

Abstract: Prior research has identified the lateral occipital complex (LOC) as a critical cortical region for the representation of object shape in humans. However, little is known about the nature of the representations contained in the LOC and their relationship to the perceptual experience of shape. We used human functional MRI to measure the physical, behavioral, and neural similarity between pairs of novel shapes to ask whether the representations of shape contained in subregions of the LOC more closely reflect the physical stimuli themselves, or the perceptual experience of those stimuli. Perceptual similarity measures for each pair of shapes were obtained from a psychophysical same-different task; physical similarity measures were based on stimulus parameters; and neural similarity measures were obtained from multivoxel pattern analysis methods applied to anterior LOC (pFs) and posterior LOC (LO). We found that the pattern of pairwise shape similarities in LO most closely matched physical shape similarities, whereas shape similarities in pFs most closely matched perceptual shape similarities. Further, shape representations were similar across participants in LO but highly variable across participants in pFs. Together, these findings indicate that activation patterns in subregions of object-selective cortex encode objects according to a hierarchy, with stimulus-based representations in posterior regions and subjective and observer-specific representations in anterior regions.

Abstract: We present a neuroimaging experiment that examines whether males and females use distinct brain systems while performing a confrontational naming task, with specific attention to the possibility of laterality differences, as suggested by some theories of sex differences in language processing. We further address whether sex-based differences in functional brain organization might interact with object category distinctions, given that previous behavioral studies have shown some consistent processing differences between the sexes with respect to tools versus plants. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 26 participants (13 males and 13 females). Main effect and interaction analyses reveal no discernable laterality differences between the sexes. All other results, however, were consistent with previous object-naming studies. Global effects revealed dominant foci in fusiform gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus, left basal ganglia/thalamus, left middle/inferior frontal gyri, left frontal operculum, left supplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate, and left pre-central gyrus. Main contrasts for tools versus plants were likewise consistent with previous fMRI studies. Although men and women showed no discernable activation differences, hemispheric or otherwise, when collapsed across object categories, sex-by-category analyses showed selective activation for females in dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and left posterior middle temporal gyrus for tools, and selective activation for males in left posterior middle temporal gyrus for plants. We discuss the relevance of these sex-by-category effects to previous behavioral findings and theories that relate to vocabulary differences between the sexes.

Abstract: Recognition of faces is better when faces are presented in the left than right-visual-field. Furthermore, this perceptual asymmetry is a stable individual characteristic. Although it has been commonly assumed that the right hemispheric dominance for face processing underlies this left-visual-field superiority in face recognition, this neural-behavioral association has never been directly demonstrated. Here we applied functional MRI (fMRI) to measure the magnitude of the asymmetric response to faces for each subject. To determine whether the asymmetric neural response to faces is stable across sessions, subjects returned for a second fMRI session. In addition, subjects performed a behavioral experiment outside the scanner where they had to recognize centrally presented chimeric faces, which presented different identities in the right- and left-visual-field. This task yielded a measure of the magnitude of the left-visual-field bias for each subject. Our findings show that the magnitude of the asymmetry of the face-selective area in the fusiform gyrus (FFA) is highly consistent for each individual across scans. We then show that the behavioral left-visual-field asymmetry, measured outside the scanner, was strongly and specifically correlated with the asymmetry of the FFA across subjects, but not with other face-specific or nearby object-general regions. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence for the prevalent idea that perceptual asymmetries in face recognition are associated with the well-known hemispheric asymmetry for faces. We conclude that the FFA asymmetry is a highly stable individual characteristic that underlies the well-established left-visual-field superiority for face recognition.

Abstract: A central issue for understanding visual object recognition is how the cortical hierarchy represents incoming sensory information and transforms it across successive processing stages. The format of object representation in the human brain has thus far mostly been studied using adaptation paradigms because the neuronal layout of object selectivities was thought to be beyond the resolution of conventional functional MRI (fMRI). Recently, however, multivariate pattern recognition succeeded in discriminating fMRI responses of object-selective cortex to different object exemplars within a given category. Here, we use increased spatial fMRI resolution to explore size sensitivity and tolerance to size change of response patterns evoked by object exemplars across a range of three sizes. Results from Support Vector Classification on responses of the human lateral occipital complex (LOC) show that discrimination of size (for a given object) and discrimination of objects across changes in size depended on the amount of size difference. Even across the largest amount of size change, accuracy for generalization was still significant in LOC, whereas the same comparison was at chance performance in early visual (calcarine) cortex. Analyzing subregions, we further found an anterior-posterior gradient in the degree of size sensitivity and size generalization within the posterior-dorsal and anterior-ventral parts of LOC. These results speak against fully size-invariant representation of object information in human LOC and are hence congruent with findings in monkeys showing object identity and size information in population activity of inferotemporal cortex. Moreover, these results provide evidence for a fine-grained functional heterogeneity within human LOC beyond the commonly used LO/fusiform subdivision.

Abstract: We used fMRI to investigate competition during language production in two word production tasks: object naming and color naming of achromatic line drawings. Generally, fMRI activation was higher for color naming. The line drawings were followed by a word (the distractor word) that referred to either the object, a related object, or an unrelated object. The effect of the distractor word on the BOLD response was qualitatively different for the two tasks. The activation pattern suggests two different kinds of competition during lexical retrieval: (1) Task-relevant responses (e.g., red in color naming) compete with task-irrelevant responses (i.e., the object's name). This competition effect was dominant in prefrontal cortex. (2) Multiple task-relevant responses (i.e., target word and distractor word) compete for selection. This competition effect was dominant in ventral temporal cortex. This study provides further evidence for the distinct roles of frontal and temporal cortex in language production, while highlighting the effects of competition, albeit from different sources, in both regions.

Abstract: Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to improve learning and memory in several preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memantine has also been shown to reduce the levels of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides in human neuroblastoma cells as well as to inhibit A beta oligomer-induced synaptic loss. In this study, we assessed whether NMDA receptor inhibition by memantine in transgenic mice expressing human amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) is associated with cognitive benefit and amyloid burden reduction by using object recognition, micromagnetic resonance imaging (micro MRI), and histology. APP/PS1 Tg mice were treated either with memantine or with vehicle for a period of 4 months starting at 3 months of age. After treatment, the mice were subjected to an object recognition test and analyzed by ex vivo micro MRI, and histological examination of amyloid burden. micro MRI was performed following injection with gadolinium-DTPA-A beta(1-40). We found that memantine-treated Tg mice performed the same as wild-type control mice, whereas the performance of vehicle-treated Tg mice was significantly impaired (P = 0.0081, one-way ANOVA). Compared with vehicle-treated animals, memantine-treated Tg mice had a reduced plaque burden, as determined both histologically and by micro MRI. This reduction in amyloid burden correlates with an improvement in cognitive performance. Thus, our findings provide further evidence of the potential role of NMDA receptor antagonists in ameliorating AD-related pathology. In addition, our study shows, for the first time, the utility of micro MRI in conjunction with gadolinium-labeled A beta labeling agents to monitor the therapeutic response to amyloid-reducing agents.

Abstract: In order to explore parietal patients' difficulties in the processing of orientation information, we asked parietal patients (N = 8) and healthy and brain-damaged controls to imitate multicomponent actions where object orientation was one component. In Experiment 1 orientation was not the most relevant aspect of the action to be imitated, and the parietal group showed significant difficulties in processing object orientation. However, in Experiment 2, where orientation was placed at the top end of the goal hierarchy, the parietal group were able to process stimulus orientation sufficiently to place it within the goal hierarchy of the action and to reproduce it accurately. We conclude that patients with parietal lesions might be able to include object orientation in a goal hierarchy, but if their processing of orientation information is impaired they might be disproportionately prone to errors when object orientation is lower in the goal hierarchy and so not prioritized for processing resources.

Abstract: Although the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is known to be essential for episodic encoding, the contributions of individual MTL subregions remain unclear. Data from recognition memory studies have provided evidence that the hippocampus supports relational encoding important for later episodic recollection, whereas the perirhinal cortex has been linked with encoding that supports later item familiarity. However, extant data also strongly implicate the perirhinal cortex in object processing and encoding, suggesting that perirhinal processes may contribute to later episodic recollection of object source details. To investigate this possibility, encoding activation in MTL subregions was analyzed on the basis of subsequent memory outcome while participants processed novel scenes paired with 1 of 6 repeating objects. Specifically, encoding activation correlating with later successful scene recognition memory was evaluated against that of source recollection for the object paired with the scene during encoding. In contrast to studies reporting a link between perirhinal cortex and item familiarity, it was found that encoding activation in the right perirhinal cortex correlates with successful recollection of the paired object. Furthermore, other MTL subregions also exhibited content-specific source encoding patterns of activation, suggesting that MTL subsequent memory effects are sensitive to stimulus category.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cerebral and cerebellar networks involved in bimanual object recognition were assessed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional MR imaging by using multivariate model-free analysis, because conventional univariate model-based analysis, such as the general linear model (GLM), does not allow investigation of resting, background, and transiently task-related brain activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 14 healthy right-handed volunteers, scanned while successively performing bilateral finger movements and a bimanual tactile-tactile matching discrimination task were analyzed by using tensor-independent component analysis (TICA), which computes statistically independent spatiotemporal processes (P > .7) thought to reflect specific and distinct anatomofunctional neural networks. These results were compared with the network obtained in a previous study by using the same paradigm based on GLM to evaluate the advantages of TICA. RESULTS: TICA characterized and distinguished the following: 1) resting-state networks such as the default-mode networks, 2) networks transiently synchronized with the beginning and end of the task, such as temporo-pericentral and temporo-pericentral-occipital networks, and 3) task-related networks such as cerebello-fronto-parietal, cerebello-prefrontocingulo-insular, and cerebello-parietal networks. CONCLUSION: Bimanual tactile-tactile matching discrimination specifically recruits a complex neural network, which can be dissociated into 3 distinct but cooperative neural subnetworks related to sensorimotor function, salience detection, executive control, and, possibly, sensory expectation. This tripartite network involved in bimanual object recognition could not be demonstrated by GLM. Moreover, TICA allowed monitoring of the temporal succession of the networks recruited during the resting phase, audition of the "go" and "stop" signals, and the tactile discrimination task.

Abstract: What is the neural code for object shape? Despite intensive research, the precise nature of object representations in high-level visual cortex remains elusive. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that convex shapes are encoded in a privileged fashion by human lateral occipital complex (LOC), a region that has been implicated in object recognition. On each trial, two convex or two concave shapes that were either identical or different were presented sequentially. Critically, the convex and concave stimuli were the same except for a binocular disparity change that reversed the figure-ground assignment. The fMRI response in LOC for convex stimuli was higher for different than that for identical shape pairs, indicating sensitivity to differences in convex shape. However, when the same stimuli were seen as concave, the response for different and identical pairs was the same, indicating lower sensitivity to changes in concave shape than convex shape. This pattern was more pronounced in the anterior than that in the posterior portion of LOC. These results suggest that convex contours could be important elements in cortical object representations.

Abstract: Fear and reward learning can occur through direct experience or observation. Both channels can enhance survival or create maladaptive behavior. We used fMRI to isolate neural mechanisms of observational fear and reward learning and investigate whether neural response varied according to individual differences in neuroticism and extraversion. Participants learned object-emotion associations by observing a woman respond with fearful (or neutral) and happy (or neutral) facial expressions to novel objects. The amygdala-hippocampal complex was active when learning the object-fear association, and the hippocampus was active when learning the object-happy association. After learning, objects were presented alone; amygdala activity was greater for the fear (vs. neutral) and happy (vs. neutral) associated object. Importantly, greater amygdala-hippocampal activity during fear (vs. neutral) learning predicted better recognition of learned objects on a subsequent memory test. Furthermore, personality modulated neural mechanisms of learning. Neuroticism positively correlated with neural activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during fear (vs. neutral) learning. Low extraversion/high introversion was related to faster behavioral predictions of the fearful and neutral expressions during fear learning. In addition, low extraversion/high introversion was related to greater amygdala activity during happy (vs. neutral) learning, happy (vs. neutral) object recognition, and faster reaction times for predicting happy and neutral expressions during reward learning. These findings suggest that neuroticism is associated with an increased sensitivity in the neural mechanism for fear learning which leads to enhanced encoding of fear associations, and that low extraversion/high introversion is related to enhanced conditionability for both fear and reward learning.

Abstract: Faces are among the most informative stimuli we ever perceive: Even a split-second glimpse of a person's face tells us his identity, sex, mood, age, race, and direction of attention. The specialness of face processing is acknowledged in the artificial vision community, where contests for face-recognition algorithms abound. Neurological evidence strongly implicates a dedicated machinery for face processing in the human brain to explain the double dissociability of face- and object-recognition deficits. Furthermore, recent evidence shows that macaques too have specialized neural machinery for processing faces. Here we propose a unifying hypothesis, deduced from computational, neurological, fMRI, and single-unit experiments: that what makes face processing special is that it is gated by an obligatory detection process. We clarify this idea in concrete algorithmic terms and show how it can explain a variety of phenomena associated with face processing.

Abstract: Many everyday activities, such as driving on a busy street, require the encoding of distinctive visual objects from crowded scenes. Given resource limitations of our visual system, one solution to this difficult and challenging task is to first select individual objects from a crowded scene (object individuation) and then encode their details (object identification). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, two distinctive brain mechanisms were recently identified that support these two stages of visual object processing. While the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) selects a fixed number of about four objects via their spatial locations, the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex (LOC) encode the features of a subset of the selected objects in great detail (object shapes in this case). Thus, the inferior IPS individuates visual objects from a crowded display and the superior IPS and higher visual areas participate in subsequent object identification. Consistent with the prediction of this theory, even when only object shape identity but not its location is task relevant, this study shows that object individuation in the inferior IPS treats four identical objects similarly as four objects that are all different, whereas object shape identification in the superior IPS and the LOC treat four identical objects as a single unique object. These results provide independent confirmation supporting the dissociation between visual object individuation and identification in the brain.

Abstract: Ignoring an object slows subsequent naming responses to it, a phenomenon known as negative priming (NP). A central issue in NP research concerns the level of representation at which the effect occurs. As object naming is typically considered to involve access to abstract semantic representations, Tipper 1985 proposed that the NP effect occurred at this level of processing, and other researchers supported this proposal by demonstrating a similar result with categorically related objects (e.g., Allport et al., 1985; Murray, 1995), an effect referred to as semantic NP. However, objects within categories share more physical or structural features than objects from different categories. Consequently, the NP effect observed with categorically related objects might occur at a structural rather than semantic level of representation. We used event related fMRI interleaving overt object naming and image acquisition to demonstrate for the first time that the semantic NP effect activates the left posterior-mid fusiform and insular-opercular cortices. Moreover, both naming latencies and left posterior-mid fusiform cortex responses were influenced by the structural similarity of prime-probe object pairings in the categorically related condition, increasing with the number of shared features. None of the cerebral regions activated in a previous fMRI study of the identity NP effect (de Zubicaray et al., 2006) showed similar activation during semantic NP, including the left anterolateral temporal cortex, a region considered critical for semantic processing. The results suggest that the identity and semantic NP effects differ with respect to their neural mechanisms, and the label "semantic NP" might be a misnomer. We conclude that the effect is most likely the result of competition between structurally similar category exemplars that determines the efficiency of object name retrieval.

Abstract: How do we see an object when it is partially obstructed from view? The neural mechanisms of this intriguing process are unclear, in part because studies of visual object perception heretofore have largely used stimuli of individual objects, such as faces or common inanimate objects, each presented alone. But in natural images, visual objects are typically occluded by other objects. Computational studies indicate that the perception of an occluded object requires processes that are substantially different from those for an unoccluded object in plain view. We studied the neural substrates of the perception of occluded objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of human subjects viewing stimuli that were designed to elicit or not elicit the percept of an occluded object but were physically very similar. We hypothesized the regions that are selective for occluded objects, if they exist, will be differentially active during the two conditions. We found two regions, one in the ventral object processing pathway and another in the dorsal object processing pathway, that were significantly responsive to occluded objects. More importantly, both regions were significantly more responsive to occluded objects than to unoccluded objects, and this enhanced response was not attributable to low-level differences in the stimuli, amodal completion per se, or the behavioral task. Our results identify regions in the visual cortex that are preferentially responsive to occluded objects relative to other stimuli tested and indicate that these regions are likely to play an important role in the perception of occluded objects.

Abstract: What is the relationship between retinotopy and object selectivity in human lateral occipital (LO) cortex? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine sensitivity to retinal position and category in LO, an object-selective region positioned posterior to MT along the lateral cortical surface. Six subjects participated in phase-encoded retinotopic mapping experiments as well as block-design experiments in which objects from six different categories were presented at six distinct positions in the visual field. We found substantial position modulation in LO using standard nonobject retinotopic mapping stimuli; this modulation extended beyond the boundaries of visual field maps LO-1 and LO-2. Further, LO showed a pronounced lower visual field bias: more LO voxels represented the lower contralateral visual field, and the mean LO response was higher to objects presented below fixation than above fixation. However, eccentricity effects produced by retinotopic mapping stimuli and objects differed. Whereas LO voxels preferred a range of eccentricities lying mostly outside the fovea in the retinotopic mapping experiment, LO responses were strongest to foveally presented objects. Finally, we found a stronger effect of position than category on both the mean LO response, as well as the distributed response across voxels. Overall these results demonstrate that retinal position exhibits strong effects on neural response in LO and indicates that these position effects may be explained by retinotopic organization.

Abstract: Decisions about object identity follow a period in which evidence is gathered and analyzed. Evidence can consist of both task-relevant external stimuli and internally generated goals and expectations. How the various pieces of information are gathered and filtered into meaningful evidence by the nervous system is largely unknown. Although object recognition is often highly efficient and accurate, errors are common. Errors may be related to faulty evidence gathering arising from early misinterpretations of incoming stimulus information. In addition, errors in task performance are known to elicit late corrective performance monitoring mechanisms that can optimize or otherwise adjust future behavior. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an extended trial paradigm of object recognition to study whether we could identify performance-based signal modulations prior to and following the moment of recognition. The rationale driving the current report is that early modulations in fMRI activity may reflect faulty evidence gathering, whereas late modulations may reflect the presence of performance monitoring mechanisms. We tested this possibility by comparing fMRI activity on correct and error trials in regions of interest (ROIs) that were selected a priori. We found pre- and postrecognition accuracy-dependent modulation in different sets of a priori ROIs, suggesting the presence of dissociable error signals.

Abstract: Everyday contextual settings create associations that later afford generating predictions about what objects to expect in our environment. The cortical network that takes advantage of such contextual information is proposed to connect the representation of associated objects such that seeing one object (bed) will activate the visual representations of other objects sharing the same context (pillow). Given this proposal, we hypothesized that the cortical activity elicited by seeing a strong contextual object would predict the occurrence of false memories whereby one erroneously "remembers" having seen a new object that is related to a previously presented object. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding of contextually related objects, and later tested recognition memory. New objects that were contextually related to previously presented objects were more often falsely judged as "old" compared with new objects that were contextually unrelated to old objects. This phenomenon was reflected by activity in the cortical network mediating contextual processing, which provides a better understanding of how the brain represents and processes context.

Abstract: Although the parahippocampal cortex (PHc) is known to be critical for memory formation, little is known about what is encoded by this area. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we examined responses to blocks of categorically coherent stimuli and found that patterns of activity in PHc were selective for not only scenes, but also for other nonspatial object categories (e.g., faces and toys). This pattern of results was also found in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), indicating that this region is not sensitive exclusively to scenes. In contrast, neither the hippocampus nor perirhinal cortex (PRc) were found to be selective for category information. The results indicate that regions within the medial temporal lobe may support distinct functions, and that the PHc appears to be particularly sensitive to category-level information.

Abstract: Smooth pursuit eye movements (SP) are driven by moving objects. The pursuit system processes the visual input signals and transforms this information into an oculomotor output signal. Despite the object's movement on the retina and the eyes' movement in the head, we are able to locate the object in space implying coordinate transformations from retinal to head and space coordinates. To test for the visual and oculomotor components of SP and the possible transformation sites, we investigated three experimental conditions: (I) fixation of a stationary target with a second target moving across the retina (visual), (II) pursuit of the moving target with the second target moving in phase (oculomotor), (III) pursuit of the moving target with the second target remaining stationary (visuo-oculomotor). Precise eye movement data were simultaneously measured with the fMRI data. Visual components of activation during SP were located in the motion-sensitive, temporo-parieto-occipital region MT+ and the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Motor components comprised more widespread activation in these regions and additional activations in the frontal and supplementary eye fields (FEF, SEF), the cingulate gyrus and precuneus. The combined visuo-oculomotor stimulus revealed additional activation in the putamen. Possible transformation sites were found in MT+ and PPC. The MT+ activation evoked by the motion of a single visual dot was very localized, while the activation of the same single dot motion driving the eye was rather extended across MT+. The eye movement information appeared to be dispersed across the visual map of MT+. This could be interpreted as a transfer of the one-dimensional eye movement information into the two-dimensional visual map. Potentially, the dispersed information could be used to remap MT+ to space coordinates rather than retinal coordinates and to provide the basis for a motor output control. A similar interpretation holds for our results in the PPC region.

Trauma Severity Indices
Abstract: Memory and neurobehavioral dysfunctions are among the sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Neurological Severity Score (NSS) includes 10 tasks and was previously designed to assess the functional status of mice after TBI. The object recognition task (ORT) measures specific episodic memory and is expressed by the percent time spent by an animal at a novel, unfamiliar object (Discrimination Index [DI]). It is an ideal tool for evaluating cognitive function after TBI. The present study sought to validate the use of the NSS and ORT in severe and mild focal TBI in mice, and to confirm that the spontaneous recovery and the radiological abnormalities, shown by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are dependent upon injury severity. Mice were subjected to severe and mild closed head injury (NSS at 1 h 7.52 +/- 0.34 and 4.62 +/- 0.14, respectively). NSS was evaluated for 25 days and showed a decrease by 3.86 +/- 0.26 and 2.54 +/- 0.35 units in the severely and mildly injured mice, respectively. ORT revealed DI in severely injured group of 51.7 +/- 6.15%, (vs approximately 75-80% in uninjured animal) on day 3 and 66.2 +/- 6.81% on day 21. In contrast, the mildly injured mice did not show cognitive impairment throughout the same period. The damage seen by MRI at 24 h after injury, strongly correlated with NSS(1h) (R = 0.87, p < 0.001). We conclude that NSS is a reliable tool for evaluation of neurological damage in head-injured mice, NSS(1h) predicts the motor dysfunction, cognitive damage, and brain-damage characteristics as depicted by T2-weighted MRI. The combined assessment of neurobehavioral and cognitive function along with MRI is most useful in evaluating recovery from injury, especially when testing effectiveness of novel treatments or genetic manipulations.

Abstract: This study examined how aging affects the spatial patterns of repetition effects associated with perceptual priming of unfamiliar visual objects. Healthy young (n = 14) and elderly adults (n = 13) viewed four repetitions of structurally possible and impossible figures while being scanned with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although explicit recognition memory for the figures was reduced in the elder subjects, repetition priming did not differ across the two age groups. Using multivariate linear modeling, we found that the spatial networks of regions that demonstrated repetition-related increases and decreases in activity were identical in both age groups, although there was a trend for smaller magnitude repetition effects in these networks in the elder adults for objects that had been repeated thrice. Furthermore, repetition-related reductions in activity in the left inferior frontal cortex for possible objects correlated with repetition-related facilitation in reaction time across both young and elder subjects. Repetition-related increases of an initially negative response were observed for both object types in both age groups in parts of the default network, suggesting that less attention was required for processing repeated stimuli. These findings extend prior studies using verbal and semantic picture priming tasks and support the view that perceptual repetition priming remains intact in later adulthood because the same spatial networks of regions continue to show repetition-related neural plasticity across the adult life span.

Abstract: Despite the complete imprint of a visual scene on the retina, the brain selects particular items for further processing. However, there is considerable debate about when and where the first attentional effects take hold in the cortex. We examined the timing of face specificity and attentional influences in the primary/secondary visual cortex (V1/V2) and in the fusiform gyrus (FG) in two experiments using magnetoencephalography (MEG). In experiment 1, using a passive viewing task, we identified three components in response to "Face," "Hand," and "Shoe" stimuli bilaterally in the FG: M(FG)100, M(FG)170, and M(FG)200-all showing a stronger preference for faces. The timing of these three activations of the FG is consistent with earlier studies claiming distinct stages of processing of visual stimuli in the first 300 ms. In experiment 2, subjects performed a gender-discrimination task on either faces or hands, drawing attention to only one of the two object categories. In addition to the previously identified three components in FG, here we found object-selective attentional enhancement first appearing in V1/V2 at around 170 ms, and then in FG at around 200 ms, i.e. concurrent with the third component. No attentional effects were evident on the first or second magnetoencephalography components. These findings may indicate that the visual input for an object is first encoded and matched to an attended "cue" object held in mind. When the attended and encoded objects match, a third stage involving attentive processing is enhanced.

Abstract: Studies of the aging brain have demonstrated that areas of the frontal cortex, along with their associated top-down executive control processes, are particularly prone to the neurodegenerative effects of age. Here, we investigate the effects of aging on brain and behavior using a novel task, which allows us to examine separate components of an individual's chosen strategy during routine problem solving. Our findings reveal that, contrary to previous suggestions of a specific decrease in cognitive flexibility, older participants show no increased level of perseveration to either the recently rewarded object or the recently relevant object category. In line with this lack of perseveration, lateral and medial regions of the orbito-frontal cortex, which are associated with inhibitory control and reward processing, appear to be functionally intact. Instead, a general loss of efficient problem-solving strategy is apparent with a concomitant decrease in neural activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is also affected during problem solving, but age-related decline within this region appears to occur at a later stage.

Abstract: The present study explored constraints on mid-fusiform activation during object discrimination. In three experiments, participants performed a matching task on simple line configurations, nameable objects, three dimensional (3-D) shapes, and colors. Significant bilateral mid-fusiform activation emerged when participants matched objects and 3-D shapes, as compared to when they matched two-dimensional (2-D) line configurations and colors, indicating that the mid-fusiform is engaged more strongly for processing structural descriptions (e.g., comparing 3-D volumetric shape) than perceptual descriptions (e.g., comparing 2-D or color information). In two of the experiments, the same mid-fusiform regions were also modulated by the degree of structural similarity between stimuli, implicating a role for the mid-fusiform in fine differentiation of similar visual object representations. Importantly, however, this process of fine differentiation occurred at the level of structural, but not perceptual, descriptions. Moreover, mid-fusiform activity was more robust when participants matched shape compared to color information using the identical stimuli, indicating that activity in the mid-fusiform gyrus is not driven by specific stimulus properties, but rather by the process of distinguishing stimuli based on shape information. Taken together, these findings further clarify the nature of object processing in the mid-fusiform gyrus. This region is engaged specifically in structural differentiation, a critical component process of object recognition and categorization.

Abstract: The ability to recognize individual faces is of crucial social importance for humans and evolutionarily necessary for survival. Consequently, faces may be "special" stimuli, for which we have developed unique modular perceptual and recognition processes. Some of the strongest evidence for face processing being modular comes from cases of prosopagnosia, where patients are unable to recognize faces whilst retaining the ability to recognize other objects. Here we present the case of an acquired prosopagnosic whose poor recognition was linked to a perceptual impairment in face processing. Despite this, she had intact object recognition, even at a subordinate level. She also showed a normal ability to learn and to generalize learning of nonfacial exemplars differing in the nature and arrangement of their parts, along with impaired learning and generalization of facial exemplars. The case provides evidence for modular perceptual processes for faces.

Abstract: In a recent study we could show that during observation of artificial object movements a similar cortical network, including the areas of the so-called human mirror neuron system (hMNS), was activated as during the observation of hand movements. The present study investigated whether activation of the hMNS during the observation of artificial object movements depends more on the visual features of the movements (buttom-up), or, by manipulating the task instructions, on the intentional goal of an observer (top-down). Using a factorial design we recorded the hemodynamic responses in 20 healthy participants while they watched arbitrary artificial object movements following two types of movement trajectories (smooth vs. discontinuous). In one part of the experiment participants had to detect color changes of two objects (color task) and in another part they had to judge whether the movement pattern of two objects could be performed with human hands (simulation task). We found stronger activation in the hMNS during the simulation than during the color task for both types of movement trajectories. In contrast, the color task activated the left ventral-occipital area (human V4). A direct comparison of smooth vs. discontinuous movement trajectories revealed significant effects neither in the structures of the hMNS nor in human V4. The present findings suggest that it is not a specific visual feature, such as a smooth biological movement trajectory, that activates the hMNS. Rather, the hMNS seems to respond when an observed movement is matched to a motor representation triggered by the intentional goal of the observer.

Abstract: Extensive psychophysical and computational work proposes that the perception of coherent and meaningful structures in natural images relies on neural processes that convert information about local edges in primary visual cortex to complex object features represented in the temporal cortex. However, the neural basis of these mid-level vision mechanisms in the human brain remains largely unknown. Here, we examine functional MRI (fMRI) selectivity for global forms in the human visual pathways using sensitive multivariate analysis methods that take advantage of information across brain activation patterns. We use Glass patterns, parametrically varying the perceived global form (concentric, radial, translational) while ensuring that the local statistics remain similar. Our findings show a continuum of integration processes that convert selectivity for local signals (orientation, position) in early visual areas to selectivity for global form structure in higher occipitotemporal areas. Interestingly, higher occipitotemporal areas discern differences in global form structure rather than low-level stimulus properties with higher accuracy than early visual areas while relying on information from smaller but more selective neural populations (smaller voxel pattern size), consistent with global pooling mechanisms of local orientation signals. These findings suggest that the human visual system uses a code of increasing efficiency across stages of analysis that is critical for the successful detection and recognition of objects in complex environments.

Abstract: Plasticity of visual systems after early brain damage has been extensively studied in animal models but poorly documented in children after visual pathway lesions. This report describes the visual recovery of a male child who had a bilateral occipital lobe infarction at the age of 2 years 6 months, 10 days after colon resection for Hirschsprung disease. In the acute phase he had severe visual impairment without visual response. Some weeks later he could perceive movement. Since then, progressive recovery of his visual acuity and oculomotor abilities has been accompanied by a progressive reduction of the visual field defect. At 6 years 8 months, visual recognition acuity was 10/10 in both eyes and neuro-ophthalmological examination was normal, except for persistence of the visual field defect in the upper hemifield and a selective impairment of higher visual functions (recognition of object presented in a hard-to-decode way [e.g. overlapping figures], or use of complex visuospatial skills). The functional recovery observed in this patient confirms the adaptive plasticity of developing visual systems after early brain lesions. It suggests that in humans, as in animal models, processes related to cerebral plasticity may take place years after a brain lesion has been sustained.

Abstract: Visual working memory (VWM) permits the maintenance of object identities and their locations across brief delays such as those accompanying eye movements. Recent neuroimaging studies have emphasized the role of the posterior parietal lobe in this process although the specific nature of this involvement in VWM remains controversial. Neuroimaging findings suggest that the parietal lobe may have a general role in remembering various types of visual information whereas neuropsychological findings suggest that parietal involvement is primarily related to motor spatial attention and spatial memory. In the present study, patients with unilateral right parietal lobe damage, lacking symptoms of neglect, were tested in several VWM old/new recognition tasks. Parietal damage lead to impaired performance on all VWM tasks, including spatial, object, and object/spatial conjunction tasks. Deficits were found across several stimulus categories. These results provide neuropsychological support for neuroimaging results, and more generally indicate that the parietal lobe serves a general role in diverse forms of VWM.

Abstract: Object-related areas in the ventral visual system in humans are known from imaging studies to be preferentially activated by object images compared with noise or texture patterns. It is unknown, however, which features of the object images are extracted and represented in these areas. Here we tested the extent to which the representation of visual classes used object fragments selected by maximizing the information delivered about the class. We tested functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level-dependent activation of highly informative object features in low- and high-level visual areas, compared with noninformative object features matched for low-level image properties. Activation in V1 was similar, but in the lateral occipital area and in the posterior fusiform gyrus, activation by "informative" fragments was significantly higher for three object classes. Behavioral studies also revealed high correlation between performance and fragments information. The results show that an objective class-information measure can predict classification performance and activation in human object-related areas.

Abstract: Abstract The lateral occipital complex (LOC) is a set of areas in the human occipito-temporal cortex responding to objects as opposed to low-level control stimuli. Conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis methods based on regional averages could not detect signals discriminative of different types of objects in this region. Here, we examined fMRI signals using multivariate pattern recognition (support vector classification) to systematically explore the nature of object-related information available in fine-grained activity patterns in the LOC. Distributed fMRI signals from the LOC allowed for above-chance discrimination not only of the category but also of within-category exemplars of everyday man-made objects, and such exemplar-specific information generalized across changes in stimulus size and viewpoint, particularly in posterior subregions. Object identity could also be predicted from responses of the early visual cortex, even significantly across the changes in size and viewpoint used here. However, a dissociation was observed between these two regions of interest in the degree of discrimination for objects relative to size: In the early visual cortex, two different sizes of the same object were even better discriminated than two different objects (in accordance with measures of pixelwise stimulus similarity), whereas the opposite was true in the LOC. These findings provide the first evidence that direct evoked fMRI activity patterns in the LOC can be different for individual object exemplars (within a single category). We propose that pattern recognition methods as used here may provide an alternative approach to study mechanisms of neuronal representation based on aspects of the fMRI response independent of those assessed in adaptation paradigms.

Abstract: A novel magnetic resonance (MR)-tracking method specifically developed to locate the ferromagnetic core of an untethered microdevice, microrobot, or nanorobot for navigation or closed-loop control purpose is described. The tracking method relies on the application of radio-frequency (RF) excitation signals tuned to the equipotential magnetic curves generated by the magnetic signature of the object being tracked. Positive contrast projections are obtained with reference to the position of the magnetic source. A correlation function performed on only one k-space line for each of the three axes and corresponding to three projections, is necessary to obtain a 3-D location of the device. In this study, the effects of the sphere size and the RF frequency offset were investigated in order to find the best contrast noise ratio (CNR) for tracking. Resolution and precision were also investigated by proper measurement of the position of a ferromagnetic sphere by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and by comparing them with the real position. This method is also tested for a moving marker where the positions found by MRI projections were compared with the ones taken with a camera. In vitro and in vivo experiments show the operation of the technique in tortuous phantom and in animal models. Although the method was developed in the prospect of new interventional MR-guided endovascular operations based on miniature untethered devices, it could also be used as a passive tracking method using tools such as catheters or guide wires.

Abstract: Autism is associated with widespread atypicalities in perception, cognition and social behavior. A crucial question concerns how these atypicalities are reflected in the underlying brain activation. One way to examine possible perturbations of cortical organization in autism is to analyze the activation of category-selective ventral visual cortex, already clearly delineated in typical populations. We mapped out the neural correlates of face, place and common object processing, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in a group of high-functioning adults with autism and a typical comparison group, under both controlled and more naturalistic, viewing conditions. There were no consistent group differences in place-related regions. Although there were no significant differences in the extent of the object-related regions, there was more variability for these regions in the autism group. The most marked group differences were in face-selective cortex, with individuals with autism evincing reduced activation, not only in fusiform face area but also in superior temporal sulcus and occipital face area. Ventral visual cortex appears to be organized differently in high-functioning adults with autism, at least for face-selective regions, although subtle differences may also exist for other categories. We propose that cascading developmental effects of low-level differences in neuronal connectivity result in a much more pronounced effect on later developing cortical systems, such as that for face-processing, than earlier maturing systems (those for objects and places).

Abstract: The primate visual system is broadly organized into two segregated processing pathways, a ventral stream for object vision and a dorsal stream for space vision. Here, evidence from functional brain imaging in humans demonstrates that object representations are not confined to the ventral pathway, but can also be found in several areas along the dorsal pathway. In both streams, areas at intermediate processing stages in extrastriate cortex (V4, V3A, MT and V7) showed object-selective but viewpoint- and size-specific responses. In contrast, higher-order areas in lateral occipital and posterior parietal cortex (LOC, IPS1 and IPS2) responded selectively to objects independent of image transformations. Contrary to the two-pathways hypothesis, our findings indicate that basic object information related to shape, size and viewpoint may be represented similarly in two parallel and hierarchically organized neural systems in the ventral and dorsal visual pathways.

Abstract: This study assesses the role of the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in the coordination of spatial information across perspective change and, in particular, in visual perspective taking--namely the capacity to know what another individual is seeing on the visual scene. Fourteen patients with unilateral temporal lobe resection and 21 control subjects performed two tasks, called 'object location memory' and 'viewpoint recognition', respectively. In the object location memory task, subjects had to memorize the position of a target object in the environment from an initial viewpoint. They were then shown the same environment from a new viewpoint and had to indicate whether or not the target object had moved. In the viewpoint recognition task, subjects had to imagine the perspective of an avatar from the initial viewpoint and then decide whether or not the new viewpoint was that of the avatar. The results showed a double dissociation, with left MTL patients being impaired in the object location memory task but not in the viewpoint recognition task and right MTL patients being impaired in the viewpoint recognition task but not in the object location memory task. Furthermore, based on multiple regression analyses between performance and the volumes of the different MTL structures, we discuss the specific involvement of the left temporopolar cortex and of the right hippocampus in different kinds of visual perspective taking.

Abstract: Several recent functional neuroimaging studies have reported robust bilateral activation (L>R) in lateral posterior parietal cortex and precuneus during recognition memory retrieval tasks. It has not yet been determined what cognitive processes are represented by those activations. In order to examine whether parietal lobe-based processes are necessary for basic episodic recognition abilities, we tested a group of 17 first-incident CVA patients whose cortical damage included (but was not limited to) extensive unilateral posterior parietal lesions. These patients performed a series of tasks that yielded parietal activations in previous fMRI studies: yes/no recognition judgments on visual words and on colored object pictures and identifiable environmental sounds. We found that patients with left hemisphere lesions were not impaired compared to controls in any of the tasks. Patients with right hemisphere lesions were not significantly impaired in memory for visual words, but were impaired in recognition of object pictures and sounds. Two lesion--behavior analyses--area-based correlations and voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM)---indicate that these impairments resulted from extra-parietal damage, specifically to frontal and lateral temporal areas. These findings suggest that extensive parietal damage does not impair recognition performance. We suggest that parietal activations recorded during recognition memory tasks might reflect peri-retrieval processes, such as the storage of retrieved memoranda in a working memory buffer for further cognitive processing.

Abstract: An important issue in contemporary cognitive neuroscience concerns the role of motor production processes in perceptual and conceptual analysis. To address this issue, we studied the performance of a large group of unilateral stroke patients across a range of tasks using the same set of common manipulable objects. All patients (n = 37) were tested for their ability to demonstrate the use of the objects, recognize the objects, recognize the corresponding object-associated pantomimes, and imitate those same pantomimes. At the group level we observed reliable correlations between object use and pantomime recognition, object use and object recognition, and pantomime imitation and pantomime recognition. At the single-case level, we document that the ability to recognize actions and objects dissociates from the ability to use those same objects. These data are problematic for the hypothesis that motor processes are constitutively involved in the recognition of actions and objects and frame new questions about the inferences that are merited by recent findings in cognitive neuroscience.

Abstract: Little is known about the neural development underlying high order visual perception. For example, in detection of structures by coherently moving dots, motion information must interact with shape-based information to enable object recognition. Tasks involving these different motion-based discriminations are known to activate distinct specialized brain areas in adults. Here, we investigate neural development of normally developing children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during perception of randomly moving point-light dots (RM), coherently moving dots that formed a 3D rotating object (SFM) and static dots. Perception of RM enhanced neural activity as compared with static dots in motion processing-related visual areas, including visual area 3a (V3a), and middle temporal area (hMT+) in 10 adults (age 20-30 years). Children (age 5-6 years) showed less pronounced activity in area V3a than adults. Perception of SFM induced enhanced neural activity as compared to RM in adults in the left parietal shape area (PSA), whereas children increased neural activity within dorsal (V3a) and ventral brain areas (lingual gyrus) of the occipital cortex. These findings provide evidence of neural development within the dorsal pathway. First, maturation was associated with enhanced activity in specialized areas within the dorsal pathway during RM perception (V3a) and SFM perception (PSA). Secondly, high order visual perception-related neural development was associated with a shift in neural activity from low level shape and motion specialized areas in children, including partially immature area V3a, to high order areas in the parietal lobule (PSA) in adults.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spatial analysis may be subdivided into between-object and within-object spatial coding. We investigated the contribution of various visual cues to grouping processes that might determine whether single or multiple objects were perceived and therefore which type of spatial coding would be used for a stimulus. METHODS: We asked three patients to make shape judgments with a series of displays showing triangular arrangements, moving from more implicit triangles defined by separate objects at the apices (between-object spatial coding) to more explicit triangles with line edges or surface texture (within-object spatial coding). RESULTS: In two patients with prosopagnosia, within-object spatial judgments were impaired, whereas between-object spatial judgments were normal. In a patient with Balint syndrome, the reverse pattern was obtained. Surface texture but not outline closure led to mandatory within-object coding in the prosopagnosic patients, whereas outline or surface texture was sufficient to support intact within-object spatial judgments in the patient with Balint syndrome. Illusory contours were ineffective in promoting within-object coding in either condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the existence of parallel representations of space for within-object and between-object processing and reveal the efficacy of different cues in determining which representation is potentially accessible.

Abstract: OBJECT: The sensitivity of spin echo (SE) experiments to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast was explored in a study of the same six subjects carried out at 3 and 7 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice, single shot, spin echo, echo planar images with a voxel size of 1 x 1 x 3 mm3 were acquired at three different echo times, during execution of a simple motor task. RESULTS: Significant activation was observed at all echo times at both field strengths. Analysis of the fractional signal change as a function of echo time indicated that the change in relaxation rate, Delta R2, at 7 T was -0.51 +/- 0.14 s (-1), which was 1.3 times larger than the value found at 3 T. Measurements of the percentage signal change on activation and temporal signal to noise ratio showed that there was an increase in the BOLD contrast to noise ratio (CNR) at 7 versus 3 T by a factor of 1.9. There was no overlap of areas of significant activation in the SE data acquired at either field strength with the site of large veins. CONCLUSION: SE-BOLD CNR in motor cortex was found to increase significantly at 7 T compared with 3 T.

Abstract: How complex multipart visual objects are represented perceptually remains a subject of ongoing investigation. One source of evidence that has been used to shed light on this issue comes from the study of individuals who fail to integrate disparate parts of visual objects. This study reports a series of experiments that examine the ability of two such patients with this form of agnosia (integrative agnosia; IA), S.M. and C.R., to discriminate and categorize exemplars of a rich set of novel objects, "Fribbles", whose visual similarity (number of shared parts) and category membership (shared overall shape) can be manipulated. Both patients performed increasingly poorly as the number of parts required for differentiating one Fribble from another increased. Both patients were also impaired at determining when two Fribbles belonged in the same category, a process that relies on abstracting spatial relations between parts. C.R., the less impaired of the two, but not S.M., eventually learned to categorize the Fribbles but required substantially more training than normal perceivers. S.M.'s failure is not attributable to a problem in learning to use a label for identification nor is it obviously attributable to a visual memory deficit. Rather, the findings indicate that, although the patients may be able to represent a small number of parts independently, in order to represent multipart images, the parts need to be integrated or chunked into a coherent whole. It is this integrative process that is impaired in IA and appears to play a critical role in the normal object recognition of complex images.

Abstract: Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore how the human brain models gaze-object relations. During scanning participants observed a human model gazing towards or away a target object presented either in isolation or flanked by a distractor object. In two further conditions the model's gaze was shifted and subsequently maintained away from the stimulus/i. These four conditions were implemented within a factorial design in which the main factors were "type of observed behavior" (gaze vs. gaze-away) and "context" (target alone vs. target flanked by a distractor). Results revealed that premotor, parietal and temporal areas, known to sub-serve the understanding of other people actions, were significantly more activated by the observation of the model gazing towards rather than away from the stimulus/i. In addition, a significant interaction indicated that, when the target was presented in isolation, neural activity within the inferior frontal gyrus, another key area for action understanding, was influenced by gaze-object relations. Our findings suggest that this area is important for the establishment of intentional gaze-object relations and indicate that the presence of a distractor interferes with the representation of such relations.

Abstract: Because our brain cannot process all visual information that enters it, we usually pay attention to only a specific aspect of our visual world. Selective visual attention modulates brain activation in cortical areas corresponding to the attended spatial location. However, visual attention has also been associated with the modulation of activation in different brain areas depending on the relevant spatial scale. In this study, we establish a link between attended spatial scale and receptive field size. We demonstrate that attention to a large or a small object in a visual scene increases activation specifically in brain regions with correspondingly large or small receptive field sizes. To analyze and visualize differential brain activation in contiguous cortical areas we used a mapping strategy evaluating the modelling parameters (beta) from functional magnetic resonance imaging data analysis. Assessment of the course of these parameters along traces in different directions in the visual cortex strengthens our conclusion that selective visual attention modulates brain areas with specific neuronal receptive field size properties corresponding to the task at hand. This also confirms predictions of models of selective attention, that attentional modulation of visual processing critically depends on the receptive field size of neurons across the visual cortex.

Abstract: The representation of words in sentences can involve the activation and integration of perceptual information. For example, readers who are asked to view pictures of objects relating to a word in a sentence are influenced by perceptual information in the sentence context-readers are faster to respond to a picture of a whole apple after reading, "There is an apple in the bag," than after reading, "There is an apple in the salad." The purpose of this study was to examine how the two cerebral hemispheres use perceptual information about words as a function of sentence context. Patients who had damage to the left or right hemisphere and age-matched control participants read sentences that described, but did not entail, the shape or state of an object. They then made recognition judgments to pictures that either matched or mismatched the perceptual form implied by the sentence. Responses and latencies were examined for a match effect -- faster and more accurate responses to pictures in the match than mismatch condition -- controlling for comprehension ability and lesion size. When comprehension ability and lesion size are properly controlled, left-hemisphere-damaged patients and control participants exhibited the expected match effect, whereas right-hemisphere-damaged participants showed no effect of match condition. These results are consistent with research implicating the right hemisphere in the representation of contextually relevant perceptual information.

Abstract: Over the past decade, object recognition work has confounded voxel response detection with potential voxel class identification. Consequently, the claim that there are areas of the brain that are necessary and sufficient for object identification cannot be resolved with existing associative methods (e.g., the general linear model) that are dominant in brain imaging methods. In order to explore this controversy we trained full brain (40,000 voxels) single TR (repetition time) classifiers on data from 10 subjects in two different recognition tasks on the most controversial classes of stimuli (house and face) and show 97.4% median out-of-sample (unseen TRs) generalization. This performance allowed us to reliably and uniquely assay the classifier's voxel diagnosticity in all individual subjects' brains. In this two-class case, there may be specific areas diagnostic for house stimuli (e.g., LO) or for face stimuli (e.g., STS); however, in contrast to the detection results common in this literature, neither the fusiform face area nor parahippocampal place area is shown to be uniquely diagnostic for faces or places, respectively.

Abstract: Object recognition is traditionally viewed as a hierarchical, bottom-up neural process. This view has been challenged recently by theoretical models and by findings indicating that top-down processes are involved in facilitating recognition. However, how such high-level information can be activated quickly enough to facilitate the bottom-up processing is yet unknown. We propose that such top-down facilitation is triggered by magnocellular information projected early and rapidly to the orbitofrontal cortex. Using human neuroimaging, we show that stimuli designed to bias processing toward the magnocellular pathway differentially activated the orbitofrontal cortex compared with parvocellular-biased stimuli. Although the magnocellular stimuli had a lower contrast than the parvocellular stimuli, they were recognized faster and just as accurately. Moreover, orbitofrontal activity predicted the performance advantage for the magnocellular, but not for the parvocellular-biased, stimuli, whereas the opposite was true in the fusiform gyrus. Last, analyses of effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling showed that magnocellular-biased stimuli significantly activated pathways from occipital visual cortex to orbitofrontal cortex and from orbitofrontal cortex to fusiform gyrus. Conversely, parvocellular-biased stimuli significantly activated a pathway from the occipital visual cortex to fusiform gyrus. Our findings support the proposal that fast magnocellular projections linking early visual and inferotemporal object recognition regions with the orbitofrontal cortex facilitate object recognition by enabling the generation of early predictions.

Abstract: Single-unit and multiunit recordings in primates have already established that decision making involves at least two general stages of neural processing: representation of evidence from early sensory areas and accumulation of evidence to a decision threshold from decision-related regions. However, the relay of information from early sensory to decision areas, such that the accumulation process is instigated, is not well understood. Using a cued paradigm and single-trial analysis of electroencephalography (EEG), we previously reported on temporally specific components related to perceptual decision making. Here, we use information derived from our previous EEG recordings to inform the analysis of fMRI data collected for the same behavioral task to ascertain the cortical origins of each of these EEG components. We demonstrate that a cascade of events associated with perceptual decision making takes place in a highly distributed neural network. Of particular importance is an activation in the lateral occipital complex implicating perceptual persistence as a mechanism by which object decision making in the human brain is instigated.

Abstract: The inferior temporal (IT) cortex in monkeys plays a central role in visual object recognition and learning. Previous studies have observed patches in IT cortex with strong selectivity for highly familiar object classes (e.g., faces), but the principles behind this functional organization are largely unknown due to the many properties that distinguish different object classes. To unconfound shape from meaning and memory, we scanned monkeys with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed classes of initially novel objects. Our data revealed a topography of selectivity for these novel object classes across IT cortex. We found that this selectivity topography was highly reproducible and remarkably stable across a 3-month interval during which monkeys were extensively trained to discriminate among exemplars within one of the object classes. Furthermore, this selectivity topography was largely unaffected by changes in behavioral task and object retinal position, both of which preserve shape. In contrast, it was strongly influenced by changes in object shape. The topography was partially related to, but not explained by, the previously described pattern of face selectivity. Together, these results suggest that IT cortex contains a large-scale map of shape that is largely independent of meaning, familiarity, and behavioral task.

Abstract: Objects seen from unusual relative to more canonical views require more time to categorize and recognize, and, according to object model verification theories, additionally recruit prefrontal processes for cognitive control that interact with parietal processes for mental rotation. To test this using functional magnetic resonance imaging, people categorized and recognized known objects from unusual and canonical views. Canonical views activated some components of a default network more on categorization than recognition. Activation to unusual views showed that both ventral and dorsal visual pathways, and prefrontal cortex, have key roles in visual object constancy. Unusual views activated object-sensitive and mental rotation (and not saccade) regions in ventrocaudal intraparietal, transverse occipital, and inferotemporal sulci, and ventral premotor cortex for verification processes of model testing on any task. A collateral-lingual sulci "place" area activated for mental rotation, working memory, and unusual views on correct recognition and categorization trials to accomplish detailed spatial matching. Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and object-sensitive lateral occipital sulcus activated for mental rotation and unusual views on categorization more than recognition, supporting verification processes of model prediction. This visual knowledge framework integrates vision and memory theories to explain how distinct prefrontal-posterior networks enable meaningful interactions with objects in diverse situations.

Abstract: OBJECT: The shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is an important cause of developmental delay in infants. Epileptic seizures are a common feature of this syndrome. The aim if this study is to analyse the impact of the early and late seizures disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively reviewed the clinical and electrophysiological findings in a series of 404 children hospitalised with SBS. RESULTS: In the acute phase, clinical epileptic seizures of various semiologies were found in 73% of the infants. Only 11% of the children had a normal EEG on admission. A poor outcome was found in 88% of the children in case of persisting EEG anomalies despite anti-epileptic treatment with 48% mortality in these patients. The development of refractory epilepsy was also associated with a poor outcome in this series. In fact 96% of the children with seizure recurrence had behavioural problems. CONCLUSIONS: The early recognition and subsequent management of these seizures is vital to prevent further neurological injury. Delayed or recurrent epileptic seizures may occur with a different semiology to the seizures in the acute phase and are also associated with a poor prognosis.

Abstract: Increasingly 7 T scanners are used for fMRI of humans and non-human primates, promising improvements in signal-to-noise, spatial resolution and specificity. A disadvantage of fMRI at 7 T, but already at 3 T, is that susceptibility artifacts from air-filled cavities like the ear canal and nasal cavity cause signal loss and distortion. This limits the applicability of fMRI in these areas, thereby limiting study of these areas, but it also limits study of processes that span large-scale cortical networks or the entire brain. Our goal is to study the inferior temporal (IT) lobe in awake monkeys because of its importance in object perception and recognition, but the functional signal is degraded by strong susceptibility gradients. To allow fMRI of this region, we used an optimized SE-EPI, which recovers signal lost with GE-EPI and we corrected for susceptibility-induced image distortion. SE-EPI has the added advantage that, in contrast to GE-EPI, where the functional signal derives to a large extent from veins, the SE-EPI signal arises from the microvasculature, and hence it better represents the neural activation. We show fMRI at 7 T of the entire visual pathway in the awake primate with robust and widespread activation in all ventral areas of the brain, including areas adjacent to the ear canal. This allows fMRI of areas that normally suffer from artifact and thus more reliable whole-brain studies.

Abstract: Visual context plays a prominent role in everyday perception. Contextual information can facilitate recognition of objects within scenes by providing predictions about objects that are most likely to appear in a specific setting, along with the locations that are most likely to contain objects in the scene. Is such identity-related ("semantic") and location-related ("spatial") contextual knowledge represented separately or jointly as a bound representation? We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) priming experiment whereby semantic and spatial contextual relations between prime and target object pictures were independently manipulated. This method allowed us to determine whether the two contextual factors affect object recognition with or without interacting, supporting a unified versus independent representations, respectively. Results revealed a Semantic x Spatial interaction in reaction times for target object recognition. Namely, significant semantic priming was obtained when targets were positioned in expected (congruent), but not in unexpected (incongruent), locations. fMRI results showed corresponding interactive effects in brain regions associated with semantic processing (inferior prefrontal cortex), visual contextual processing (parahippocampal cortex), and object-related processing (lateral occipital complex). In addition, activation in fronto-parietal areas suggests that attention and memory-related processes might also contribute to the contextual effects observed. These findings indicate that object recognition benefits from associative representations that integrate information about objects' identities and their locations, and directly modulate activation in object-processing cortical regions. Such context frames are useful in maintaining a coherent and meaningful representation of the visual world, and in providing a platform from which predictions can be generated to facilitate perception and action.

Abstract: Very little is known about the human pulvinar; suggestions for its function include relaying input from cortical areas, allocating visual attention, supporting feature binding, and other integrative processes. The diversity of hypotheses about pulvinar function highlights our lack of understanding of its basic role. A conspicuously missing piece of information is whether the human pulvinar encodes visual information topographically. The answer to this question is crucial, as it dramatically constrains the sorts of computational and cognitive processes that the pulvinar might carry out. Here we used fMRI to test for position-sensitive encoding in the human pulvinar. Subjects passively viewed flickering Gabor stimuli, and as the spatial separation between Gabors increased, the correlation between patterns of activity across voxels within the right pulvinar decreased significantly. The results demonstrate the existence of precise topographic coding in the human pulvinar lateralized to the right hemisphere, and provide a means of functionally localizing this topographic region.

Abstract: Working memory is a set of cognitive operations facilitating higher order cognition and complex behavior. A particularly important aspect of working memory is the linkage of past sensory events to planned actions. While the lateral prefrontal cortex has been proposed to serve this temporal integrative function, the precise mapping of specific components of this process within the lateral prefrontal cortex has yet to be clarified. In this human fMRI experiment, we employed a paradigm that segregates retrospective sensory maintenance from prospective action planning processes. Our results suggest that the ventrolateral PFC supports retrospective sensory representations while the dorsolateral PFC supports prospective action representations.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI) and magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) visualize an internal distribution of current density and/or conductivity by injecting current into an electrically conductive object such as the human body using an MRI scanner. MREIT measures the induced magnetic flux density which appears in the phase part of the acquired MR image data. Recently, the injected current nonlinear encoding (ICNE) method in MREIT extended the duration of the current injection until the end of a reading gradient to maximize the signal intensity of the magnetic flux density. In this paper, we investigate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the magnetic flux density measured by the ICNE method in the presence of a zero-mean Gaussian random noise in measured k-space MR data. Based on the analysis of the noise standard deviation s(B(z)) of the magnetic flux density, we determine an optimal combination between the current injection pulse width T(c) and data acquisition time T(s) which minimize the noise level of the measured magnetic flux density for a given echo time T(E). On one hand, theoretically, the proposed ICNE MR pulse sequence using the optimal data acquisition time T(s)* reduces the noise level of the measured magnetic flux density by about 42.3% compared with the optimal data acquisition time of the conventional MREIT pulse sequence. On the other hand, practically, the prolonged T(s)* may result in undesirable artifacts including blurring, chemical shift and phase error along the phase encoding direction. We observe that the noise level is a function of the data acquisition time T(s) and the rate of change in the noise level is slow near T(s)=T(s)*. Numerical phantom experiments show that a compromised T(s) between the ordinary data acquisition time and the optimal T(s)* reduces a relatively large amount of undesirable artifacts and almost maintains the optimized noise level of the measured magnetic flux density.

Abstract: Decision making can be conceptualized as the culmination of an integrative process in which evidence supporting different response options accumulates gradually over time. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activity leading up to and during decisions about perceptual object identity. Pictures were revealed gradually and subjects signaled the time of recognition (T(R)) with a button press. We examined the time course of T(R)-dependent activity to determine how brain regions tracked the timing of recognition. In several occipital regions, activity increased primarily as stimulus information increased, suggesting a role in lower-level sensory processing. In inferior temporal, frontal, and parietal regions, a gradual buildup in activity peaking in correspondence with T(R) suggested that these regions participated in the accumulation of evidence supporting object identity. In medial frontal cortex, anterior insula/frontal operculum, and thalamus, activity remained near baseline until T(R), suggesting a relation to the moment of recognition or the decision itself. The findings dissociate neural processes that function in concert during perceptual recognition decisions.

Abstract: Ventral frontal cortex is commonly involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The smell identification test (SIT), object alternation (OA), and the Iowa gambling task (IGT) are associated with this brain region in experimental and neuropsychological research. We examined the relationship of performance on these tests to residual structural brain integrity quantified from MRI in 58 TBI patients, including 18 patients with focal cortical contusions and 40 patients with diffuse injury only. Image analysis yielded regional volumetric measures of gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Multivariate analyses identified distributed patterns of regional volume loss associated with test performance across all three behavioral measures. The tasks were sensitive to effects of TBI. In multivariate analyses, performance in all three tasks was related to gray matter loss including ventral frontal cortex, but the SIT was most sensitive to ventral frontal cortex damage, even in patients without focal lesions. The SIT was further related to temporal lobe and posterior cingulate/retrosplenial volumes. OA and the IGT were associated with superior medial frontal volumes. Complex tasks, such as OA and the IGT, do not consistently localize to a single cortical region. The SIT is associated with the integrity of ventral frontal regions, but it is also affected by distributed damage, although the contribution of undetected olfactory tract or bulb damage could not be ruled out. This study illustrates the scope and limitations of functional localization in human ventral frontal cortex.

Abstract: The influence of action knowledge associated with novel objects was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were trained on complex actions associated with novel objects ("tools") and had experience manipulating other visually similar novel objects ("shapes"). During scanning, participants viewed, imagined grasping, and imagined using the objects. Based on previous neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings, our primary goal was to examine frontal and parietal regions subserving action representations associated with visual objects, namely the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), the left ventral premotor cortex (VPM) and the presupplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA). We predicted differences between the tool and shape stimuli, modulated also by task demands. In viewing, we found greater effect sizes in the left VPM and IPL for tools versus shapes. In grasping, there was similar activation with both object types. The largest differences existed in using, in which greater effect sizes were found for tools versus shapes in left IPL and pre-SMA, and marginally in the left VPM. We suggest that representations of tools extend beyond classically defined affordances and recruit processing about both graspability and known action plans in tasks involving visual memory, motor imagery, and motor execution.

Abstract: We assessed the prediction that object structural cues could benefit the learning of object-action relationships in ideomotor apraxia (IMA). A total of 15 patients with left-hemisphere stroke, 11 of whom exhibited IMA, and 10 healthy subjects were trained to match novel gestures to novel tool pictures that were either High- or Low-Afforded by their associated tools. Learning was assessed with recognition and production tests. Only IMA patients demonstrated better recognition of High- than Low-Afforded gestures, and their recognition of High-Afforded gestures was statistically comparable to the other groups. This finding suggests that apraxics may rely abnormally on object structure when learning to associate novel gestures and tools. Finally, the "affordance benefit" was associated with relative sparing of structures in the dorsal visual processing stream. These data are consistent with the proposal that two routes may mediate skilled action, one specialized for stored information, and the other responsive to object structure, and that deficient gesture learning may be compensated by "bootstrapping" intact dorsal stream coding of action.

Abstract: A new deformable model, the charged fluid model (CFM), that uses the simulation of charged elements was used to segment medical images. Poisson's equation was used to guide the evolution of the CFM in two steps. In the first step, the elements of the charged fluid were distributed along the propagating interface until electrostatic equilibrium was achieved. In the second step, the propagating front of the charged fluid was deformed in response to the image gradient. The CFM provided sub-pixel precision, required only one parameter setting, and required no prior knowledge of the anatomy of the segmented object. The characteristics of the CFM were compared to existing deformable models using CT and MR images. The results indicate that the CFM is a promising approach for the segmentation of anatomic structures in a wide variety of medical images across different modalities.

Abstract: There have been several studies supporting the notion of a ventral-dorsal distinction in the primate cortex for visual object processing, whereby the ventral stream specializes in object identification, and the dorsal stream is engaged during object localization and interaction. There is also a growing body of evidence supporting a ventral stream that specializes in lexical (i.e., whole-word) reading, and a dorsal stream that is engaged during sub-lexical reading (i.e., phonetic decoding). Here, we consider the extent to which word-reading processes are located in regions either intersecting with, or unique from, regions that sub-serve object processing along these streams. Object identification was contrasted with lexical-based reading, and object interaction processing (i.e., deciding how to interact with an object) was contrasted with sub-lexical reading. Our results suggest that object identification and lexical-based reading are largely ventral and modular, showing mainly unique regions of activation (parahippocampal and occipital-temporal gyri function associated with object identification, and lingual, lateral occipital, and posterior inferior temporal gyri function associated with lexical-based reading) and very little shared activation (posterior inferior frontal gyrus). Object interaction processing and phonetic decoding are largely dorsal, and show both modular regions of activation (more lateralized to the dorsal-frontal right hemisphere for pseudohomophone naming, and more to the dorsal-frontal left hemisphere for the object interaction task) as well as significant shared regions of processing (precentral gyri, left inferior frontal cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left lateral occipital cortex, and superior posterior temporal gyri). Given that the perceptual experimental conditions show primarily modular and very little shared processing, whereas the analytical conditions show both substantial modular and shared processing, we discuss a reconsideration of "modularity of mind" which involves a continuum between strictly modular processing and varying degrees of shared processing, and which also depends on the nature of the tasks compared (i.e., perceptual versus analytical).

Abstract: Landmarks play an important role in successful navigation. To successfully find your way around an environment, navigationally relevant information needs to be stored and become available at later moments in time. Evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies shows that the human parahippocampal gyrus encodes the navigational relevance of landmarks. In the present event-related fMRI experiment, we investigated memory consolidation of navigationally relevant landmarks in the medial temporal lobe after route learning. Sixteen right-handed volunteers viewed two film sequences through a virtual museum with objects placed at locations relevant (decision points) or irrelevant (nondecision points) for navigation. To investigate consolidation effects, one film sequence was seen in the evening before scanning, the other one was seen the following morning, directly before scanning. Event-related fMRI data were acquired during an object recognition task. Participants decided whether they had seen the objects in the previously shown films. After scanning, participants answered standardized questions about their navigational skills, and were divided into groups of good and bad navigators, based on their scores. An effect of memory consolidation was obtained in the hippocampus: Objects that were seen the evening before scanning (remote objects) elicited more activity than objects seen directly before scanning (recent objects). This increase in activity in bilateral hippocampus for remote objects was observed in good navigators only. In addition, a spatial-specific effect of memory consolidation for navigationally relevant objects was observed in the parahippocampal gyrus. Remote decision point objects induced increased activity as compared with recent decision point objects, again in good navigators only. The results provide initial evidence for a connection between memory consolidation and navigational ability that can provide a basis for successful navigation.

Abstract: Working memory (WM) tasks engage a network of brain regions that includes primary, unimodal, and multimodal associative cortices. Little is known, however, about whether task practice influences these types of regions differently. In this experiment, we used event-related fMRI to examine practice-related activation changes in different region types over the course of a scanning session while participants performed a delayed-recognition task. The task contained separate WM processing stages (encoding, maintenance, retrieval) and different materials (object, spatial), which allowed us to investigate the influence of practice on different component processes. We observed significant monotonic decreases, and not increases, in fMRI signal primarily in unimodal and multimodal regions. These decreases occurred during WM encoding and retrieval, but not during maintenance. Finally, regions specific to the type of memoranda (e.g., spatial or object) showed a lesser degree of sensitivity to practice as compared to regions activated by both types of memoranda, suggesting that these regions may be specialized more for carrying out processing within a particular modality than for experience-related flexibility. Overall, these findings indicate that task practice does not have a uniform effect on stages of WM processing, the type of WM memoranda being processed or on different types of brain regions. Instead, regions engaged during WM encoding and retrieval may have greater capacity for functional plasticity than WM maintenance. Additionally, the degree of specialization within brain regions may determine processing efficiency. Unimodal and multimodal regions that participate in both object and spatial processing may be specialized for flexible experience-related change, while those supporting primary sensorimotor processing may operate at optimal efficiency and are less susceptible to practice.

Abstract: Working memory (WM) evoked by linguistic cues for allocentric spatial and egocentric spatial aspects of a visual scene was investigated by correlating fMRI BOLD signal (or "activation") with performance on a spatial-relations task. Subjects indicated the relative positions of a person or object (referenced by the personal pronouns "he/she/it") in a previously shown image relative to either themselves (egocentric reference frame) or shifted to a reference frame anchored in another person or object in the image (allocentric reference frame), e.g. "Was he in front of you/her?" Good performers had both shorter response time and more correct responses than poor performers in both tasks. These behavioural variables were entered into a principal component analysis. The first component reflected generalised performance level. We found that the frontal eye fields (FEF), bilaterally, had a higher BOLD response during recall involving allocentric compared to egocentric spatial reference frames, and that this difference was larger in good performers than in poor performers as measured by the first behavioural principal component. The frontal eye fields may be used when subjects move their internal gaze during shifting reference frames in representational space. Analysis of actual eye movements in three subjects revealed no difference between egocentric and allocentric recall tasks where visual stimuli were also absent. Thus, the FEF machinery for directing eye movements may also be involved in changing reference frames within WM.

Abstract: A method of four-dimensional (4D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been implemented and evaluated. It consists of retrospective sorting and slice stacking of two-dimensional (2D) images using an external signal for motion monitoring of the object to be imaged. The presented method aims to determine the tumour trajectories based on a signal that is appropriate for monitoring the movement of the target volume during radiotherapy such that the radiation delivery can be adapted to the movement. For evaluation of the 4D-MRI method, it has been applied to a dynamic lung phantom, which exhibits periodic respiratory movement of a porcine heart-lung explant with artificial pulmonary nodules. Anatomic changes of the lung phantom caused by respiratory motion have been quantified, revealing hysteresis. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the presented method of 4D-MRI. In particular, it enables the determination of trajectories of periodically moving objects with an uncertainty in the order of 1 mm.

Abstract: Indeterminate art invokes a perceptual dilemma in which apparently detailed and vivid images resist identification. We used event-related fMRI to study visual perception of representational, indeterminate and abstract paintings. We hypothesized increased activation along a gradient of posterior-to-anterior ventral visual areas with increased object resolution, and postulated that object resolution would be associated with visual imagery. Behaviorally, subjects were faster to recognize familiar objects in representational than in both indeterminate and abstract paintings. We found activation within a distributed cortical network that includes visual, parietal, limbic and prefrontal regions. Representational paintings, which depict scenes cluttered with familiar objects, evoked stronger activation than indeterminate and abstract paintings in higher-tier visual areas. Perception of scrambled paintings was associated with imagery-related activation in the precuneus and prefrontal cortex. Finally, representational paintings evoked stronger activation than indeterminate paintings in the temporoparietal junction. Our results suggest that perception of familiar content in art works is mediated by object recognition, memory recall and mental imagery, cognitive processes that evoke activation within a distributed cortical network.

Abstract: Lexical-semantic investigations in cognitive neuroscience have focused on conceptual knowledge of concrete objects. By contrast, relational concepts have been largely ignored. We examined thematic role and locative knowledge in 14 left-hemisphere-damage patients. Relational concepts shift cognitive focus away from the object to the relationship between objects, calling into question the relevance of traditional sensory-functional accounts of semantics. If extraction of a relational structure is the critical cognitive process common to both thematic and locative knowledge, then damage to neural structures involved in such an extraction would impair both kinds of knowledge. If the nature of the relationship itself is critical, then functional neuroanatomical dissociations should occur. Using a new lesion analysis method, we found that damage to the lateral temporal cortex produced deficits in thematic role knowledge and damage to inferior fronto-parietal regions produced deficits in locative knowledge. In addition, we found that conceptual knowledge of thematic roles dissociates from its mapping onto language. These relational knowledge deficits were not accounted for by deficits in processing nouns or verbs or by a general deficit in making inferences. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that manners of visual motion serve as a point of entry for thematic role knowledge and networks dedicated to eye gaze, whereas reaching and grasping serve as a point of entry for locative knowledge. Intermediary convergence zones that are topographically guided by these sensory-motor points of entry play a critical role in the semantics of relational concepts.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the differences of cortical activation patterns in young and elderly healthy subjects for object and spatial visual processing using a face- and location-matching task. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a face- and a location-matching task in 15 young (mean age: 28 +/- 9 years) and 19 elderly (mean age: 71 +/- 6 years) subjects. Each experiment consisted of 7 blocks alternating between activation and control condition. For face matching, the subjects had to indicate whether two displayed faces were identical or different. For location matching, the subjects had to press a button whenever two objects had an identical position. For control condition, we used a perception task with abstract images. Functional imaging was performed on a 1.5-tesla scanner using an EPI sequence. RESULTS: In the face-matching task, the young subjects showed bilateral (right > left) activation in the occipito-temporal pathway (occipital gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus). Predominantly right hemispheric activations were found in the fusiform gyrus, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (inferior and middle frontal gyrus) and the superior parietal gyrus. In the elderly subjects, the activated areas in the right fronto-lateral cortex increased. An additional activated area could be found in the medial frontal gyrus (right > left). In the location-matching task, young subjects presented increased bilateral (right > left) activation in the superior parietal lobe and precuneus compared with face matching. The activations in the occipito-temporal pathway, in the right fronto-lateral cortex and the fusiform gyrus were similar to the activations found in the face-matching task. In the elderly subjects, we detected similar activation patterns compared to the young subjects with additional activations in the medial frontal gyrus. CONCLUSION: Activation patterns for object-based and spatial visual processing were established in the young and elderly healthy subjects. Differences between the elderly and young subjects could be evaluated, especially by using a face-matching task.

Abstract: The logarithm of the odds ratio (LogOdds) is frequently used in areas such as artificial neural networks, economics, and biology, as an alternative representation of probabilities. Here, we use LogOdds to place probabilistic atlases in a linear vector space. This representation has several useful properties for medical imaging. For example, it not only encodes the shape of multiple anatomical structures but also captures some information concerning uncertainty. We demonstrate that the resulting vector space operations of addition and scalar multiplication have natural probabilistic interpretations. We discuss several examples for placing label maps into the space of LogOdds. First, we relate signed distance maps, a widely used implicit shape representation, to LogOdds and compare it to an alternative that is based on smoothing by spatial Gaussians. We find that the LogOdds approach better preserves shapes in a complex multiple object setting. In the second example, we capture the uncertainty of boundary locations by mapping multiple label maps of the same object into the LogOdds space. Third, we define a framework for non-convex interpolations among atlases that capture different time points in the aging process of a population. We evaluate the accuracy of our representation by generating a deformable shape atlas that captures the variations of anatomical shapes across a population. The deformable atlas is the result of a principal component analysis within the LogOdds space. This atlas is integrated into an existing segmentation approach for MR images. We compare the performance of the resulting implementation in segmenting 20 test cases to a similar approach that uses a more standard shape model that is based on signed distance maps. On this data set, the Bayesian classification model with our new representation outperformed the other approaches in segmenting subcortical structures.

Abstract: The ability of humans to distinguish consciously between new and previously encountered objects can be probed with visual recognition memory tasks that require explicit old-new discriminations. Medial temporal-lobe (MTL) lesions impair performance on such tasks. Within the MTL, both perirhinal cortex and the hippocampus have been implicated. Cognitive processes can also be affected by past object encounters in the absence of conscious recognition, as in repetition priming tasks. Past functional neuroimaging findings in healthy individuals suggest that even in tasks that require conscious recognition decisions for visual stimuli, posterior cortical structures in the ventral visual pathway distinguish between old and new objects at a nonconscious level. Conclusive evidence that differentiates the neural underpinnings of conscious from nonconscious processes in recognition memory, however, is still missing. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings for the MTL have been inconsistent towards this end. In the present fMRI study, we tested whether perirhinal and hippocampal contributions to recognition memory can be distinguished from those of occipito-temporal structures in the ventral visual pathway based on the participants' reported conscious awareness of prior occurrence. Images of objects with a large degree of feature overlap served as stimuli; they were selected to ensure an involvement of perirhinal cortex in the present recognition task, based on evidence from past lesion-based research. We found that both perirhinal cortex and occipito-temporal cortex showed a differential old-new response that reflected a repetition-related decrease in activity (i.e., new > old). Whereas in perirhinal cortex this decrease was observed with respect to whether subjects reported objects to be old or new, irrespective of the true item status, in occipito-temporal cortex it occurred in relation to whether objects were truly old or new, irrespective of the participants' conscious reports. Hippocampal responses differed in their exact pattern from those of perirhinal cortex, but were also related to the conscious recognition reports. These results indicate that both perirhinal and hippocampal contributions can be distinguished from those of occipito-temporal structures in the ventral visual pathway based on the participants' reported conscious awareness of prior occurrence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Maternal love, which may be the core of maternal behavior, is essential for the mother-infant attachment relationship and is important for the infant's development and mental health. However, little has been known about these neural mechanisms in human mothers. We examined patterns of maternal brain activation in response to infant cues using video clips. METHODS: We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements while 13 mothers viewed video clips, with no sound, of their own infant and other infants of approximately 16 months of age who demonstrated two different attachment behaviors (smiling at the infant's mother and crying for her). RESULTS: We found that a limited number of the mother's brain areas were specifically involved in recognition of the mother's own infant, namely orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), periaqueductal gray, anterior insula, and dorsal and ventrolateral parts of putamen. Additionally, we found the strong and specific mother's brain response for the mother's own infant's distress. The differential neural activation pattern was found in the dorsal region of OFC, caudate nucleus, right inferior frontal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, thalamus, substantia nigra, posterior superior temporal sulcus, and PFC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the highly elaborate neural mechanism mediating maternal love and diverse and complex maternal behaviors for vigilant protectiveness.

Abstract: We have previously used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess specific anterolateral temporal regions involved in object recognition, providing a novel technique for evaluating functional status in temporal lobe epilepsy (i.e., a site directed approach). However, a method that combines high temporal resolution with spatial mapping is needed to isolate the specific processes associated with these regions (i.e., a process specific approach). In the current study, we evaluated the cognitive processes associated with object recognition and their relationship to the temporal lobe using high-density event-related potentials (ERPs). N300 and late positive component (LPC) responses were examined using a word-picture matching task, with three factors: congruity (match/mismatch), level of abstraction (basic/superordinate), and object category (natural/artificial). The N300 and LPC were analyzed in terms of their temporal characteristics as well as their spatial characteristics through source analysis. The results showed that the N300 primarily indexed processing of congruity and level of abstraction, whereas the LPC primarily indexed processing of object category. In agreement with previous functional imaging studies, N300 and LPC source analysis results confirmed temporal lobe involvement in object recognition. Importantly, LPC object category differences were detected in the anterior temporal lobe. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior temporal lobe differences were reliable--with greater activity for natural objects in 84% of subjects. The findings are discussed in terms of clinical applications that use spatiotemporal ERP differences to evaluate functional status of the temporal lobes.

Abstract: Changes in power in the mu frequency band (8-13Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is thought to indirectly reflect the activity of mirror neurons in premotor cortex. Activation of these neurons by self-performed, observed or imagined motor actions is assumed to produce asynchronous firing and a reduction in mu rhythm oscillation (referred to as mu suppression) in sensorimotor cortex. A recent fMRI study by Saygin et al. [Saygin AP, Wilson SM, Hagler Jr DJ, Bates E, Sereno MI. Point-light biological motion perception activates human premotor cortex. J Neurosci 2004;24:6181-8] revealed that the premotor brain regions containing mirror-neurons are also activated in response to point-light human motion. The perceived movement of these light cues are integrated into one percept of a complete human action (e.g. jumping jacks), rather than seen as individual moving lights. The present study examined whether recruitment of the mirror neuron system, as reflected in mu rhythm suppression, mediates recognition of point-light biological motion. Changes in mu power were recorded while subjects viewed point-light biological motion videos, matched scrambled versions of these animations, and visual white-noise (baseline). The results revealed that point-light biological animations produced mu suppression relative to baseline, while scrambled versions of these animations did not. This supports the hypothesis that the mirror neuron system is involved in inferring human actions by recovering object information from sparse input.

Abstract: The cortical integration of auditory and visual features is crucial for efficient object recognition. Previous studies have shown that audiovisual (AV) integration is affected by where and when auditory and visual features occur. However, because relatively little is known about the impact of what is integrated, we here investigated the impact of semantic congruency and object familiarity on the neural correlates of AV integration. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify regions involved in the integration of both (congruent and incongruent) familiar animal sounds and images and of arbitrary combinations of unfamiliar artificial sounds and object images. Unfamiliar object images and sounds were integrated in the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), possibly reflecting learning of novel AV associations. Integration of familiar, but semantically incongruent combinations also correlated with IFC activation and additionally involved the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). For highly familiar semantically congruent AV pairings, we again found AV integration effects in pSTS and additionally in superior temporal gyrus. These findings demonstrate that the neural correlates of object-related AV integration reflect both semantic congruency and familiarity of the integrated sounds and images.

Abstract: The human brain distinguishes between landmarks placed at navigationally relevant and irrelevant locations. However, to provide a successful wayfinding mechanism not only landmarks but also the routes between them need to be stored. We examined the neural representation of a memory for route direction and a memory for relevant landmarks. Healthy human adults viewed objects along a route through a virtual maze. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired during a subsequent subliminal priming recognition task. Prime-objects either preceded or succeeded a target-object on a preciously learned route. Our results provide evidence that the parahippocampal gyri distinguish between relevant and irrelevant landmarks whereas the inferior parietal gyrus, the anterior cingulate gyrus as well as the right caudate nucleus are involved in the coding of route direction. These data show that separated memory systems store different spatial information. A memory for navigationally relevant object information and a memory for route direction exist.

Abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures via minimal surface extraction using gradient-based metrics is a popular approach, but exhibits some limits in the case of weak or missing contour information. We propose a new framework to define metrics, robust to missing image information. Given an object of interest we combine gray-level information and knowledge about the spatial organization of cerebral structures, into a fuzzy set which is guaranteed to include the object's boundaries. From this set we derive a metric which is used in a minimal surface segmentation framework. We show how this metric leads to improved segmentation of subcortical gray matter structures. Quantitative results on the segmentation of the caudate nucleus in T1 MRI are reported on 18 normal subjects and 6 pathological cases.

Abstract: Previous reports suggest that the internal organization of semantic memory is in terms of different "types of knowledge," including "sensory" (information about perceptual features), "action" (motor-based knowledge of object utilization), and "functional" (abstract properties, as function and context of use). Consistent with this view, a specific loss of action knowledge, with preserved functional knowledge, has been recently observed in patients with left frontoparietal lesions. The opposite pattern (impaired functional knowledge with preserved action knowledge) was reported in association with anterior inferotemporal lesions. In the present study, the cerebral representation of action and functional knowledge was investigated using event-related analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Fifteen subjects were presented with pictures showing pairs of manipulable objects and asked whether the objects within each pair were used with the same manipulation pattern ("action knowledge" condition) or in the same context ("functional knowledge" condition). Direct comparisons showed action knowledge, relative to functional knowledge, to activate a left frontoparietal network, comprising the intraparietal sulcus, the inferior parietal lobule, and the dorsal premotor cortex. The reverse comparison yielded activations in the retrosplenial and the lateral anterior inferotemporal cortex. These results confirm and extend previous neuropsychological data and support the hypothesis of the existence of different types of information processing in the internal organization of semantic memory.

Abstract: Impairments in visual discrimination beyond long-term declarative memory have been found in amnesic individuals, with hippocampal lesions resulting in deficits in scene discrimination and perirhinal cortex damage affecting object discrimination. To complement these findings, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that in healthy participants oddity judgment for novel trial-unique scenes, compared with face or size oddity, was associated with increased posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex activity. In contrast, perirhinal and anterior hippocampus activity was observed during unfamiliar trial-unique face oddity judgment, when contrasted with scene or size oddity tasks. Activity in all of these regions decreased as the stimuli were repeated across trials, reflecting the participants' increasing familiarity with the stimuli. This change was significant in all areas, with the exception of the perirhinal cortex, right anterior hippocampus, and to a lesser extent the left anterior hippocampus during face oddity judgment. One possibility is that the activity in these regions may not reflect entirely episodic memory encoding but, in part, processes beyond the mnemonic domain. Thus, the perirhinal cortex, and possibly anterior hippocampus, may play a more generic role in the discrimination and processing of objects.

Abstract: It is well known that pain attracts attention and interferes with cognition. Given that the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are largely unknown, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and presented visual objects with or without concomitant pain stimuli. To test for the specificity of pain, we compared this modulatory effect with a previously established modulatory effect of working memory on visual object processing. Our data showed a comparable behavioral effect of both types of modulation and identified the lateral occipital complex (LOC) as the site of modulation in the ventral visual stream, for both pain and working memory. However, the sources of these modulatory effects differed for the two processes. Whereas the source of modulation for working memory could be attributed to the parietal cortex, the modulatory effect of pain was observed in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), an area ideally suited to link pain perception and attentional control.

Abstract: Previous research has investigated intentional retrieval of contextual information and contextual influences on object identification and word recognition, yet few studies have investigated context effects in episodic memory for objects. To address this issue, unique objects embedded in a visually rich scene or on a white background were presented to participants. At test, objects were presented either in the original scene or on a white background. A series of behavioral studies with young adults demonstrated a context shift decrement (CSD)-decreased recognition performance when context is changed between encoding and retrieval. The CSD was not attenuated by encoding or retrieval manipulations, suggesting that binding of object and context may be automatic. A final experiment explored the neural correlates of the CSD, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Parahippocampal cortex (PHC) activation (right greater than left) during incidental encoding was associated with subsequent memory of objects in the context shift condition. Greater activity in right PHC was also observed during successful recognition of objects previously presented in a scene. Finally, a subset of regions activated during scene encoding, such as bilateral PHC, was reactivated when the object was presented on a white background at retrieval. Although participants were not required to intentionally retrieve contextual information, the results suggest that PHC may reinstate visual context to mediate successful episodic memory retrieval. The CSD is attributed to automatic and obligatory binding of object and context. The results suggest that PHC is important not only for processing of scene information, but also plays a role in successful episodic memory encoding and retrieval. These findings are consistent with the view that spatial information is stored in the hippocampal complex, one of the central tenets of Multiple Trace Theory.

Abstract: Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown greater medial temporal lobe activation (MTL) for associative memory encoding relative to deep item-oriented encoding. Greater MTL activation has also been reported for associative novelty detection. Although it has been suggested that these patterns of MTL activation could reflect the creation of novel associations into memory, it is unclear whether associative encoding and associative novelty detection rely on the same MTL substructures. In this study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) to reproduce previous reports of greater hippocampal activation for associative encoding using both arbitrary and semantically related object pairs. This paradigm allowed us to assess whether the requirement for associative processing at encoding interacts with associative novelty. Contrasting the pattern of activation for associative versus item-oriented encoding revealed greater right hippocampal activation as well as parahippocampal activation bilaterally, reproducing the findings from previous PET experiments. The orthogonal contrast between arbitrary and related pairs revealed greater activation in the left parahippocampal region, but no significant interaction between the type of encoding (associative or item oriented) and the type of pairs (arbitrary or semantically related) was observed in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). These results suggest that both associative processing and associative novelty detection can activate the MTL. Most importantly, this study suggests that associative processing can activate the MTL regardless of the pre-existence of an association between the items of a pair.

Abstract: Behavioral differences in the visual processing of objects and backgrounds as a function of cultural group are well documented. Recent neuroimaging evidence also points to cultural differences in neural activation patterns. Compared with East Asians, Westerners' visual processing is more object focused, and they activate neural structures that reflect this bias for objects. In a recent adaptation study, East Asian older adults showed an absence of an object-processing area but normal adaptation for background areas. In the present study, 75 young and old adults (half East Asian and half Western) were tested in an fMR-adaptation study to examine differences in object and background processing as well as object-background binding. We found equivalent background processing in the parahippocampal gyrus in all four groups, diminished binding processes in the hippocampus in elderly East Asians and Westerners, and diminished object processing in elderly versus young adults in the lateral occipital complex. Moreover, elderly East Asians showed significantly less adaptation response in the object areas than did elderly Westerners. These findings demonstrate the malleability of perceptual processes as a result of differences in cohort-specific experiences or in cultural exposure over time.

Abstract: Visual input from the left and right visual fields is processed predominantly in the contralateral hemisphere. Here we investigated whether this preference for contralateral over ipsilateral stimuli is also found in high-level visual areas that are important for the recognition of objects and faces. Human subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed and attended faces, objects, scenes, and scrambled images in the left or right visual field. With our stimulation protocol, primary visual cortex responded only to contralateral stimuli. The contralateral preference was smaller in object- and face-selective regions, and it was smallest in the fusiform gyrus. Nevertheless, each region showed a significant preference for contralateral stimuli. These results indicate that sensitivity to stimulus position is present even in high-level ventral visual cortex.

Abstract: The functional organization of human sensory cortex was studied by comparing intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of local field potentials in neurosurgical patients with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) obtained in healthy subjects. Using naturalistic movie stimuli, we found a tight correlation between these two measures throughout the human sensory cortex. Importantly, the correlation between the iEEG and fMRI signals was site-specific, exhibiting neuroanatomically specific coupling. In several cortical sites the iEEG activity was confined strictly to one object category. This site selectivity was not limited to faces but included other object categories such as houses and tools. The selectivity of the iEEG signals to images of different object categories was remarkably higher when compared with the selectivity of the corresponding fMRI signals. A plausible interpretation of the fMRI and iEEG results concerns cortical organization in which object categories are organized in a mosaic of narrowly tuned object-selective clusters.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The cerebral and cerebellar network involved in a bimanual object recognition was studied in blood oxygenation dependent level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Nine healthy right-handed volunteers were scanned (1) while performing bilateral finger movements (nondiscrimination motor task), and (2) while performing a bimanual tactile-tactile matching discrimination task using small chess pieces (tactile discrimination task). RESULTS: Extensive activations were specifically observed in the parietal (SII, superior lateral lobule), insular, prefrontal, cingulate and neocerebellar cortices (HVIII), with a left predominance in motor areas, during the tactile discrimination task in contrast to the findings during the nondiscrimination motor task. CONCLUSION: Bimanual tactile-tactile matching discrimination recruits multiple sensorimotor and associative cerebral and neocerebellar networks (including the cerebellar second homunculus, HVIII), comparable to the neural circuits involved in unimanual tactile object recognition.

Abstract: Impaired retrieval of conceptual knowledge for actions has been associated with lesions of left premotor, left parietal, and left middle temporal areas [Tranel, D., Kemmerer, D., Adolphs, R., Damasio, H., & Damasio, A. R. Neural correlates of conceptual knowledge for actions. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 409-432, 2003]. Here we aimed at characterizing the differential contribution of these areas to the retrieval of conceptual knowledge about actions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), different categories of pictograms (whole-body actions, manipulable and nonmanipulable objects) were presented to healthy subjects. fMRI data were analyzed using SPM2. A conjunction analysis of the neural activations elicited by all pictograms revealed ( p<.05, corrected) a bilateral inferior occipito-temporal neural network with strong activations in the right and left fusiform gyri. Action pictograms contrasted to object pictograms showed differential activation of area MT+, the inferior and superior parietal cortex, and the premotor cortex bilaterally. An analysis of psychophysiological interactions identified contribution-dependent changes in the neural responses when pictograms triggered the retrieval of conceptual action knowledge: Processing of action pictograms specifically enhanced the neural interaction between the right and left fusiform gyri, the right and left middle temporal cortices (MT+), and the left superior and inferior parietal cortex. These results complement and extend previous neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies by showing that knowledge about action concepts results from an increased coupling between areas concerned with semantic processing (fusiform gyrus), movement perception (MT+), and temporospatial movement control (left parietal cortex).

Abstract: Subjects deciding whether two objects presented at angular disparity are identical or mirror versions of each other usually show response times that linearly increase with the angle between objects. This phenomenon has been termed mental rotation. While there is widespread agreement that parietal cortex plays a dominant role in mental rotation, reports concerning the involvement of motor areas are less consistent. From a theoretical point of view, activation in motor areas suggests that mental rotation relies upon visuo-motor rather than visuo-spatial processing alone. However, the type of information that is processed by motor areas during mental rotation remains unclear. In this study we used event-related fMRI to assess whether activation in parietal and dorsolateral premotor areas (dPM) during mental rotation is distinctively related to processing spatial orientation information. Using a newly developed task paradigm we explicitly separated the processing steps (encoding, mental rotation proper and object matching) required by mental rotation tasks and additionally modulated the amount of spatial orientation information that had to be processed. Our results show that activation in dPM during mental rotation is not strongly modulated by the processing of spatial orientation information, and that activation in dPM areas is strongest during mental rotation proper. The latter finding suggests that dPM is involved in more generalized processes such as visuo-spatial attention and movement anticipation. We propose that solving mental rotation tasks is heavily dependent upon visuo-motor processes and evokes neural processing that may be considered as an implicit simulation of actual object rotation.

Abstract: It has been proposed that vision-for-perception and vision-for-action are subserved by distinct streams of visual processing, the ventral and dorsal stream, respectively [Milner, A. D., Goodale, M. A., 1995. The visual brain in action. Oxford University Press, Oxford]. Such a distinction has been supported by a recent functional magnetic resonance (fMR) adaptation study [Valyear, K. F., Culham, J. C., Sharif, N., Westwood, D., Goodale, M. A., 2006. A double dissociation between sensitivity to changes in object identity and object orientation in the ventral and dorsal visual streams: A human fMRI study. Neuropsychologia 44, 218-228], which demonstrated selectivity to object identity but not object orientation within the ventral stream, and selectivity to object orientation but not object identity within the dorsal stream. These results were interpreted as suggesting that changes to object identity (but not to orientation) would alter the representation of the stimulus in the perceptual/recognition system, whereas changes in object orientation (but not necessarily identity) would alter the coding of the stimulus within a visuomotor system concerned with behaviour such as grasping. If orientation sensitivity in the dorsal stream does reflect such a potential for action, then this sensitivity should be specific to graspable objects. Using an fMR adaptation paradigm, we presented participants with an image of either a graspable or non-graspable stimulus, followed by the same image in either the original orientation or its mirror image. One region within the dorsal stream, the lateral occipito-parietal junction (lOPJ), was shown to be sensitive to orientation changes for graspable stimuli; this region did not show orientation sensitivity for non-graspable stimuli. Thus, it appears that the sensitivity to orientation changes in this region is specific to graspable objects, presumably because such changes affect the affordances of graspable but not non-graspable objects.

Abstract: We studied, with functional MRI, how neuronal processing for visual objects progresses in the human brain by measuring suppressive responses to stimulus pairs. Two concentric rectangular frames of slightly different sizes were presented such that the smaller frame was shown first, followed by the larger dominant frame, with interstimulus intervals of 0, 50 and 240-ms. The functional MRI response at 50-ms decreased along the ventral visual pathway. The response at 240-ms interstimulus interval was suppressed after a fusiform area at which the response at 50-ms interstimulus interval was highly suppressed already and the responses at 0, 50 and 240-ms interstimulus intervals showed a V-shaped dependence on those interstimulus intervals. These observations show a way of progression of the information processing along visual object recognition pathway.

Abstract: Behavioral studies have shown that object recognition becomes severely impaired at fast presentation rates, indicating a limitation in temporal processing capacity. Here, we studied whether this behavioral limit in object recognition reflects limitations in the temporal processing capacity of early visual areas tuned to basic features or high-level areas tuned to complex objects. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to measure the temporal processing capacity of multiple areas along the ventral visual pathway progressing from the primary visual cortex (V1) to high-level object-selective regions, specifically the fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Subjects viewed successive images of faces or houses at presentation rates varying from 2.3 to 37.5 items/s while performing an object discrimination task. Measures of the temporal frequency response profile of each visual area revealed a systematic decline in peak tuning across the visual hierarchy. Areas V1-V3 showed peak activity at rapid presentation rates of 18-25 items/s, area V4v peaked at intermediate rates (9 items/s), and the FFA and PPA peaked at the slowest temporal rates (4-5 items/s). Our results reveal a progressive loss in the temporal processing capacity of the human visual system as information is transferred from early visual areas to higher areas. These data suggest that temporal limitations in object recognition likely result from the limited processing capacity of high-level object-selective areas rather than that of earlier stages of visual processing.

Abstract: Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that heterotopic tissue of patients with "double cortex" is activated during motor and somatosensory tasks. Activation in patients with malformations of cortical development (MCD) has been variable, likely due to the heterogeneity of the disorder. We examined clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological, and functional MRI findings in a patient with intractable epilepsy secondary to MCD in the left temporal cortex. Invasive EEG monitoring revealed that the dysplastic tissue was not involved in ictal onset of seizures. Functional MRI tests of motion and object processing, memory encoding, and language demonstrated no activation within dysplastic tissue. Hemispheric asymmetries in activation for motion and object processing were evident, favoring the right hemisphere--a pattern not evident in controls. These weaker activations in the patient were present in tissue proximal to the seizure focus. Thus, nonepileptogenic dysplastic tissue may not support cognitive functions, with abnormal processing evident in epileptogenic tissue.

Abstract: What are the basic visual cues that determine our preference towards mundane everyday objects? We previously showed that a highly potent cue is the nature of the object's contour: people generally like objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp-angled contour. This bias is hypothesized here to stem from an implicit perception of potential threat conveyed by sharp elements. Using human neuroimaging to test this hypothesis, we report that the amygdala, a brain structure that is involved in fear processing and has been shown to exhibit activation level that is proportional to arousal in general, is significantly more active for everyday sharp objects (e.g., a sofa with sharp corners) compared with their curved contour counterparts. Therefore, our results indicate that a preference bias towards a visual object can be induced by low-level perceptual properties, independent of semantic meaning, via visual elements that on some level could be associated with threat. We further present behavioral results that provide initial support for the link between the sharpness of the contour and threat perception. Our brains might be organized to extract these basic contour elements rapidly for deriving an early warning signal in the presence of potential danger.

Abstract: We performed whole-brain fMRI to explore the neural mechanisms that contribute to the ability to manipulate an object with complex dynamics. Subjects grasped a weighted flexible ruler and balanced it in an unstable equilibrium position as an archetype of grasping an object with complex dynamics. This was contrasted with squeezing a soft foam ball as an archetype of grasping an object with simple dynamics. We hypothesized that changes in activity in primary motor cortex (MI) would be similar under the two conditions, since muscle activation was matched, which was confirmed. We hypothesized further that the cerebellum would be selectively activated when manipulating the flexible ruler because the ability to make the adjustments necessary to balance the ruler would require an internal dynamics model, represented in the cerebellum. As predicted, the ipsilateral cerebellum was strongly activated when balancing the weighted ruler whereas only moderate activation was found when squeezing the foam ball. We also found evidence for selective activation of areas, previously implicated in tactile object recognition, when holding the flexible ruler. We speculate that these areas, which include secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), Brodmann area 40 and insula, integrate tactile and proprioceptive information in the context of controlling the orientation of the flexible ruler and provide appropriate feedback to MI. We speculate that the failure to find activation of these areas when squeezing the ball was due to the fact that tactile stimulation was entirely self-produced, resulting in the attenuation of cortical sensory activity (Blakemore, S.-J., Wolpert, D.M., Frith, C.D., 1998. Central cancellation of self-produced tickle sensation. Nat. Neurosci. 1, 635-640, Blakemore, S.-J., Frith, C.D., Wolpert, D.M., 2001. The cerebellum is involved in predicting the sensory consequences of action. NeuroReport 12, 1879-1884).

Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for multiple object segmentation in medical images that respects the topological properties and relationships of structures as given by a template. The technique, known as topology-preserving, anatomy-driven segmentation (TOADS), combines advantages of statistical tissue classification, topology-preserving fast marching methods, and image registration to enforce object-level relationships with little constraint over the geometry. When applied to the problem of brain segmentation, it directly provides a cortical surface with spherical topology while segmenting the main cerebral structures. Validation on simulated and real images characterises the performance of the algorithm with regard to noise, inhomogeneities, and anatomical variations.

Abstract: Object category learning is a fundamental ability, requiring the combination of "bottom-up" stimulus-driven with "top-down" task-specific information. It therefore may be a fruitful domain for study of the general neural mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity. A simple model predicts that category learning involves the formation of a task-independent shape-selective representation that provides input to circuits learning the categorization task, with the computationally appealing prediction of facilitated learning of additional, novel tasks over the same stimuli. Using fMRI rapid-adaptation techniques, we find that categorization training (on morphed "cars") induced a significant release from adaptation for small shape changes in lateral occipital cortex irrespective of category membership, compatible with the sharpening of a representation coding for physical appearance. In contrast, an area in lateral prefrontal cortex, selectively activated during categorization, showed sensitivity posttraining to explicit changes in category membership. Further supporting the model, categorization training also improved discrimination performance on the trained stimuli.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The concept of acupuncture point localisation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is based on millenary practical experience. Modern imaging methods such as PET, MRI and SPECT have been used primary for the investigation of the mechanisms of action of acupuncture. In this pilot single-case study we have evaluated the technical possibilities for in-vivo imaging of the anatomical relations of acupuncture points using state of the art MRI. METHODS: Preliminary experiments relating to the quality of acupuncture needles under the setting of MRI were done both with stainless steel and gold needles. In a second step, in-vivo imaging was carried out. A licensed acupuncture practitioner (RM) chose two points belonging to the so-called extraordinary vessels. In 2 sequential, separate procedures, he inserted himself gold acupuncture needles using a neutral technique (known as Ping Bu Ping Xie) into the Dai mai and Shen mai points, i.e. gall bladder 26 and bladder 62. Imaging was done on a Siemens Magnetom Avanto MR scanner using a head array and body coil. Mainly T1-weighted imaging sequences, as routinely used for patient exams, were used to obtain multi-slice images. RESULTS: In the preliminary experiments only acupuncture needles made of gold showed enough stability in order to be used for further imaging procedures. Using an onion and a banana as an object, further studies showed that the gold needles produced a void defect that corresponds to the tip of the inserted needle, while at the same time an artefactually increased diameter was observed. The in-vivo experiments showed that the Dai mai point was in relation to the abdominal internal oblique muscle. The Shen mai point artefact showed up close to the longus and brevis peroneal tendons at the fibular malleolus. Side effects related to heating or burning were not observed. Improved anatomical recognition was obtained using 3D-volume rendering techniques. CONCLUSION: Through an adequate choice of acupuncture material (gold needles) as well as of ideal MRI imaging sequences it has been possible to visualize the anatomical characteristics at the acupuncture points Dai mai and Shen mai in-vivo. At the selected sites the needles showed a relation to tendino-fascial and muscular structures. These anatomical structures fit well into the recently described WOMED concept of lateral tension in which these acupuncture points play a regulatory role.

Abstract: Object working memory (WM) engages a disseminated neural network, although the extent to which the length of time that data is held in WM influences regional activity within this network is unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study a delayed matching to sample task in 14 healthy subjects, manipulating the duration of mnemonic delay. Across all lengths of delay, successful recognition was associated with the bilateral engagement of the inferior and middle frontal gyri and insula, the medial and inferior temporal, dorsal anterior cingulate and the posterior parietal cortices. As the length of time that data was held in WM increased, activation at recognition increased in the medial temporal, medial occipito-temporal, anterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices. These results confirm the components of an object WM network required for successful recognition, and suggest that parts of this network, including the medial temporal cortex, are sensitive to the duration of mnemonic delay.

Abstract: Ultrasound is a universal guidance tool for many medical procedures, whereas it is of poor image quality and resolution. Merging high-contrast image information from other image modalities enhances the guidance capability of ultrasound. However, few registration methods work well for it. In this paper we present a surface-to-image registration technique for mono- or multimodal medical data concerning ultrasound. This approach is able to automatically register the object surface to its counterpart in image volume. Three similarity measurements are investigated in the rigid registration experiments of the pubic arch in transrectal ultrasound images. It shown that the selection of the similarity function is related to the ultrasound characteristics of the object to be registered.

Abstract: A new approach to align an image of a medical object with a given prototype is proposed. Visual appearance of the images, after equalizing their signals, is modelled with a new Markov-Gibbs random field with pairwise interaction model. Similarity to the prototype is measured by a Gibbs energy of signal co-occurrences in a characteristic subset of pixel pairs derived automatically from the prototype. An object is aligned by an affine transformation maximizing the similarity by using an automatic initialization followed by gradient search. Experiments confirm that our approach aligns complex objects better than popular conventional algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a multi-object prior shape model for use in curve evolution-based image segmentation. Our prior shape model is constructed from a family of shape distributions (cumulative distribution functions) of features related to the shape. Shape distribution-based object representations possess several desired properties, such as robustness, invariance, and good discriminative and generalizing properties. Further, our prior can capture information about the interaction between multiple objects. We incorporate this prior in a curve evolution formulation for shape estimation. We apply this methodology to problems in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Object recognition deficits are well documented in certain neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, herpes simplex encephalitis). Although agnosic problems have been documented in some patients with schizophrenia (Gabrovska et al., 2003), no study has investigated whether such deficits differentially affect specific categories of information (as they sometimes do in neurological cases). METHOD: In Part I of this study, we compared object recognition in 55 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 22 age- and NART IQ-matched healthy controls. In Part II, we present a detailed case study of one patient with schizophrenia (DH) who displays a severe category specific semantic knowledge for living things. RESULTS: Of the patients with schizophrenia, 75% had object recognition below the 5th percentile, and in 11% of cases, a highly specific classical category dissociation emerged (5 cases with nonliving deficit and 1 with living deficit); and two other patients showed strong dissociation for living things. These findings provide convincing evidence of a classical double dissociation across the two categories. In Part II, the in-depth case study of one schizophrenic patient (DH), documented a profound agnosia for living things. While DH displayed intact low level perceptual and spatial ability and could copy drawings, he was severely impaired at naming, picture-name matching, semantic fluency, and could not describe or draw items from memory. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of impaired object recognition in most schizophrenic patients, along with highly selective category specific deficits in a minority, is discussed with reference to similar findings in neurological patients.

Abstract: High-level visual cortex in humans includes functionally defined regions that preferentially respond to objects, faces and places. It is unknown how these regions develop and whether their development relates to recognition memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the development of several functionally defined regions including object (lateral occipital complex, LOC)-, face ('fusiform face area', FFA; superior temporal sulcus, STS)- and place ('parahippocampal place area', PPA)-selective cortices in children (ages 7-11), adolescents (12-16) and adults. Right FFA and left PPA volumes were substantially larger in adults than in children. This development occurred by expansion of FFA and PPA into surrounding cortex and was correlated with improved recognition memory for faces and places, respectively. In contrast, LOC and STS volumes and object-recognition memory remained constant across ages. Thus, the ventral stream undergoes a prolonged maturation that varies temporally across functional regions, is determined by brain region rather than stimulus category, and is correlated with the development of category-specific recognition memory.

Abstract: The multiple-views-plus-transformation variant of object model verification theories predicts that parietal regions that are critical for mental rotation contribute to visual object cognition. Some neuroimaging studies have shown that the intraparietal sulcus region is critically involved in mental rotation. Other studies indicate that both ventral and dorsal posterior regions are object-sensitive and involved in object perception and categorization tasks. However, it is unknown whether dorsal object-sensitive areas overlap with regions recruited for object mental rotation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to test this directly. Participants performed standard tasks of object categorization, mental rotation, and eye movements. Results provided clear support for the prediction, demonstrating overlap between dorsal object-sensitive regions in ventral-caudal intraparietal sulcus (vcIPS) and an adjacent dorsal occipital area and the regions that are activated during mental rotation but not during saccades. In addition, object mental rotation (but not saccades) activated object-sensitive areas in lateral dorsal occipitotemporal cortex (DOT), and both mental rotation and object categorization recruited ventrolateral prefrontal cortex areas implicated in attention, working memory, and cognitive control. These findings provide clear evidence that a prefrontal-posterior cortical system implicated in mental rotation, including the occipitoparietal regions critical for this spatial task, is recruited during visual object categorization. Altogether, the findings provide a key link in understanding the role of dorsal and ventral visual areas in spatial and object perception and cognition: Regions in occipitoparietal cortex, as well as DOT cortex, have a general role in visual object cognition, supporting not only mental rotation but also categorization.

Abstract: We present a case (SE) with integrative visual agnosia following ischemic stroke affecting the right dorsal and the left ventral pathways of the visual system. Despite his inability to identify global hierarchical letters [Navon, D. (1977). Forest before trees: The precedence of global features in visual perception. Cognitive Psychology, 9, 353-383], and his dense object agnosia, SE showed normal global-to-local interference when responding to local letters in Navon hierarchical stimuli and significant picture-word identity priming in a semantic decision task for words. Since priming was absent if these features were scrambled, it stands to reason that these effects were not due to priming by distinctive features. The contrast between priming effects induced by coherent and scrambled stimuli is consistent with implicit but not explicit integration of features into a unified whole. We went on to show that possible/impossible object decisions were facilitated by words in a word-picture priming task, suggesting that prompts could activate perceptually integrated images in a backward fashion. We conclude that the absence of SE's ability to identify visual objects except through tedious serial construction reflects a deficit in accessing an integrated visual representation through bottom-up visual processing alone. However, top-down generated images can help activate these visual representations through semantic links.

Abstract: To understand the relative contributions of primary motor cortex (M1) and area F5 of the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) to visually guided grasp, we made simultaneous multiple electrode recordings from the hand representations of these two areas in two adult macaque monkeys. The monkeys were trained to fixate, reach out and grasp one of six objects presented in a pseudorandom order. In M1 326 task-related neurons, 104 of which were identified as pyramidal tract neurons, and 138 F5 neurons were analyzed as separate populations. All three populations showed activity that distinguished the six objects grasped by the monkey. These three populations responded in a manner that generalized across different sets of objects. F5 neurons showed object/grasp related tuning earlier than M1 neurons in the visual presentation and premovement periods. Also F5 neurons generally showed a greater preference for particular objects/grasps than did M1 neurons. F5 neurons remained tuned to a particular grasp throughout both the premovement and reach-to-grasp phases of the task, whereas M1 neurons showed different selectivity during the different phases. We also found that different types of grasp appear to be represented by different overall levels of activity within the F5-M1 circuit. Altogether these properties are consistent with the notion that F5 grasping-related neurons play a role in translating visual information about the physical properties of an object into the motor commands that are appropriate for grasping, and which are elaborated within M1 for delivery to the appropriate spinal machinery controlling hand and digit muscles.

Abstract: Recent work in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) has reported a double dissociation in AD and SD on tests of visual discrimination, with poor performance on spatial tests in AD and impaired face discrimination in SD. This pattern has been attributed to the different patterns of atrophy seen in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in these two neurodegenerative conditions. To investigate whether this functional distinction would extend to another task that employed different types of spatial and object stimuli, two groups of AD and SD patients were assessed on a simple test involving discriminations between blended stimuli. While neither group showed impairment when asked to discriminate objects and colour patches, the SD patients showed a selective deficit in the discrimination of faces whereas the AD patients had significant difficulties discriminating landscapes. These findings extend existing theoretical accounts of MTL function, and challenge current concepts of cognitive impairment in dementia.

Prosopagnosia/*pathology/*physiopathology
Abstract: One of the most remarkable disorders following brain damage is prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces. While a number of cases of prosopagnosia have been described at the behavioral level, the functional neuroanatomy of this face recognition impairment, and thus the brain regions critically involved in normal face recognition, has never been specified in great detail. Here, we used anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to present the detailed functional neuroanatomy of a single case of acquired prosopagnosia (PS; Rossion, B., Caldara, R., Seghier, M., Schuller, A.-M., Lazeyras, F., Mayer, E., 2003a. A network of occipito-temporal face-sensitive areas besides the right middle fusiform gyrus is necessary for normal face processing. Brain 126, 2381-95; Rossion, B., Joyce, C.A., Cottrell, G.W., Tarr, M.J., 2003b. Early lateralization and orientation tuning for face, word, and object processing in the visual cortex. Neuroimage 20, 1609-24) with normal object recognition. First, we clarify the exact anatomical location and extent of PS' lesions in relation to (a) retinotopic cortex, (b) face-preferring regions, and (c) other classical visual regions. PS' main lesion - most likely causing her prosopagnosia - is localized in the posterior part of the right ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This lesion causes a left superior paracentral scotoma, as frequently observed in cases of prosopagnosia. While the borders of the early visual areas in the left hemisphere could be delineated well, the extensive posterior right-sided lesion hampered a full specification of the cortical representation of the left visual field. Using multiple scanning runs, face-preferring activation was detected within the right middle fusiform gyrus (MFG) in the so-called 'fusiform face area' ('FFA'), but also in the left inferior occipital gyrus (left 'OFA'), and in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). The dorsal part of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) and the human middle temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) were localized bilaterally. The color-preferring region V4/V8 was localized only in the left hemisphere. In the right hemisphere, the posterior lesion spared the ventral part of LOC, a region that may be critical for the preserved object recognition abilities of the patient, and the restriction of her deficit to the category of faces. The presumptive functions of both structurally damaged and preserved regions are discussed and new hypotheses regarding the impaired and preserved abilities of the patient during face and non-face object processing are derived. Fine-grained neurofunctional analyses of brain-damaged single cases with isolated recognition deficits may considerably improve our knowledge of the brain regions critically involved in specific visual functions, such as face recognition.

Abstract: Computation of object orientation could be an independent process from those of other object features, but currently neither the location of human brain areas selectively coding orientation information nor an optimum experimental paradigm have yet been established. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain activation in the parietal cortices related to object orientation. Using an Arabic digit whose spatial attributes were carefully manipulated, we found parietal areas exclusively sensitive to object orientation, but not to general spatial attention. It seems that, by excluding confounds such as mental manipulation or working memory as well as inherent spatial information within the stimuli, functional segregation within the parietal lobe can be effectively probed.

Abstract: Ideational apraxia is characterized by impaired knowledge of action concepts and proper object usage. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at investigating the neural system underlying conceptual knowledge for proper object use in healthy subjects, when the effects of visuospatial properties and perceptual modality were taken into account. Subjects performed semantic decision tasks requiring retrieval of knowledge about either object functional purposes (functional task) or visuospatial object properties (visuospatial task) and perceptual control tasks. The semantic tasks were performed with pairs of either written object names or object drawings. Activation for the functional task in common for words and pictures, compared with the visuospatial and control tasks, was found in left parietal-temporal-occipital (PTO) junction, inferior frontal, anterior dorsal premotor, and presupplementary motor areas. Ventral inferior frontal cortex activation correlated negatively with reaction time in the functional condition. No specific activation characterized the visuospatial task compared with the functional task. The conceptual tasks, compared with the control tasks, demonstrated overlapping activation in left PTO junction, prefrontal, dorsal premotor, cuneus, and inferior temporal areas. These results outline the neural processes underlying conceptual knowledge for proper object use. The left ventral inferior frontal gyrus might facilitate behavioral decisions regarding functional/pragmatical object properties.

Abstract: Despite the tremendous growth in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), susceptibility induced static field inhomogeneity at air/tissue interface have limited the study of ventral brain regions engaged in object recognition and other processes. Furthermore, the spatial extent of fMRI activations in this region may be obscured by contribution of large vessels distant from the precipitating neural events. In this report, a diffusion weighted spiral-in image acquisition was employed to recover fMRI signal in the ventral brain during object recognition with high temporal resolution, as well as to suppress large vessel contributions. The combined methodology of the ventral signal recovery and vascular signal reduction can thus be advantageous for fMRI investigations at the statically inhomogeneous areas.

Abstract: A segmental active contour model integrating region information is proposed. Different deformation schemes are used at two stages for segmenting the object correctly in image plane. At the first stage the contour of the model is divided hierarchically into several segments, each of which deforms respectively using affine transformation. After the contour deforms to the approximate boundary of object, a fine matching method using statistical information of local region to redefine the external energy of the model is used to make the contour fit the object's boundary exactly. The algorithm is effective, as the reformative approaches of computing the internal energy and external energy are proposed to reduce the algorithm complexity. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is robust to local minima and able to search for concave objects.

Abstract: OBJECT: Patients with hereditary cancer syndromes may be at increased risk for the development of tumor-to-tumor metastases. To gain insight into the biological nature of these lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), to determine their prevalence in a familial neoplasia syndrome, and to better define their management, the authors retrospectively examined a series of cases in which metastatic lesions developed within hemangioblastomas in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. METHODS: The study included all cases of VHL disease in which patients underwent resection of a CNS hemangioblastoma that contained a metastasis or were found at autopsy to have a metastasis to a hemangioblastoma between January 2002 and December 2005 at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Clinical, histopathological, imaging, and surgical and/or autopsy findings were analyzed. Metastasis to a CNS hemangioblastoma was found in six resected tumors (8% of all hemangioblastomas resected from patients with VHL disease at the NINDS during the study period) from six patients (five women, one man; mean age at surgery 42.5 years). The primary site of metastatic disease was the kidney in five patients (renal cell carcinoma) and the pancreas in one (a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor). Only one patient had systemic metastases at the time of resection of the hemangioblastoma containing the metastasis. Neurologically, all patients had remained at baseline or were improved at last clinical follow-up examination (mean follow-up duration 16.5 months, range 3-40 months). In all cases, postoperative imaging revealed that the hemangioblastoma resection was complete, and there was no evidence of recurrence in any of the patients at the last follow up. Two patients (including one who was also in the surgical group) were found at autopsy to have CNS metastases exclusively to spinal hemangioblastomas. CONCLUSIONS: Hemangioblastomas are an early and preferred site for metastasis in VHL disease. Emerging histopathological techniques may lead to recognition of an increasing number of cases of tumor-to-hemangioblastoma metastasis. Management of cases involving tumor-to-hemangioblastoma metastases in VHL disease should be based on the histological characteristics of the primary tumor, extent of the primary disease, and completeness of the resection.

Abstract: A fundamental but unanswered question about the human visual system concerns the way in which misoriented objects are recognized. One hypothesis maintains that representations of incoming stimuli are transformed via parietally based spatial normalization mechanisms (eg mental rotation) to match view-specific representations in long-term memory. Using fMRI, we tested this hypothesis by directly comparing patterns of brain activity evoked during classic mental rotation and misoriented object recognition involving everyday objects. BOLD activity increased systematically with stimulus rotation within the ventral visual stream during object recognition and within the dorsal visual stream during mental rotation. More specifically, viewpoint-dependent activity was significantly greater in the right superior parietal lobule during mental rotation than during object recognition. In contrast, viewpoint-dependent activity was significantly greater in the right fusiform gyrus during object recognition than during mental rotation. In addition to these differences in viewpoint-dependent activity, object recognition and mental rotation produced distinct patterns of brain activity, independent of stimulus rotation: object recognition resulted in greater overall activity within ventral stream visual areas and mental rotation resulted in greater overall activity within dorsal stream visual areas. The present results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that misoriented object recognition is mediated by structures within the parietal lobe that are known to be involved in mental rotation.

Abstract: Several functional areas are proposed to reside in human lateral occipitotemporal cortex, including the motion-selective human homolog of macaque area MT (hMT), object-form-selective lateral occipital complex (LO), and body-selective extrastriate body area (EBA). Indeed, several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported significant activation overlap among these regions. The standard interpretation of this overlap would be that the common areas of activation reflect engagement of common neural systems. Alternatively, motion, object form, and body form may be processed independently within this general region. To distinguish these possibilities, we first analyzed the lateral occipitotemporal responses to motion, objects, bodies, and body parts with whole-brain group-average analyses and within-subjects functional region of interest (ROI) analyses. The activations elicited by these stimuli, each relative to a matched control, overlapped substantially in the group analysis. When hMT, LO, and EBA were defined functionally within subjects, each ROI in each hemisphere (except right-hemisphere hMT) showed significant selectivity for motion, intact objects, bodies, and body parts, although only the peak voxel of each region was tested. In contrast, multi-voxel analyses of variations in selectivity patterns revealed that visual motion, object form, and the form of the human body elicited three relatively independent patterns of fMRI activity in lateral occipitotemporal cortex. Multi-voxel approaches, in contrast to other methods, can reveal the functional significance of overlapping fMRI activity in extrastriate cortex and, by extension, elsewhere in the brain.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to further elucidate the mechanisms of early and automatic object processing using a masked picture priming paradigm with both identity and exemplar repetition in functional MRI (fMRI). Masked repetition priming has been commonly used with words to isolate automatic, rapidly occurring mechanisms involved in visual word recognition; however, studies using the technique of masked priming with rapid presentation of pictures have been limited. This study demonstrates how the masked priming technique can be used to study early, automatic processing of rapidly presented complex objects. Temporal-occipital regions previously found to be sensitive to repetition priming in both masked word and unmasked picture studies were found to show repetition suppression for the identity primes only. Most notably, when divided into anterior and posterior divisions, the fusiform gyrus showed anatomically specific repetition suppression only in the posterior portion. This finding is comparable to that found in a previous study of masked word priming, and the similarity may suggest an overlap in the early identification processes for visual word form and visual object processing in this region. Finally, masked repetition of different exemplar objects did not result in reliable neural effects, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of the more semantic-based, different exemplar priming may occur later or require the intervention of conscious processes.

Abstract: A left hemisphere stroke patient presented a disproportionate difficulty for body parts knowledge without autotopagnosia. The deficit concerned the lexical-semantic representation of body parts and was most severe for limbs. The ability to gesture was spared and action naming was not more impaired than object naming. On the basis of normal naming latencies, we conclude that limbs are the most vulnerable component of the overall category of body parts. This vulnerability is not explained by unbalanced nuisance variables. More cognitive effort is probably required for the appropriate differentiation of limbs during semantic processing and lexical access.

Abstract: Visual object recognition relies critically on learning. However, little is known about the effect of object learning in human visual cortex, and in particular how the spatial distribution of training effects relates to the distribution of object and face selectivity across the cortex before training. We scanned human subjects with high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed novel object classes, both before and after extensive training to discriminate between exemplars within one of these object classes. Training increased the strength of the response in visual cortex to trained objects compared with untrained objects. However, training did not simply induce a uniform increase in the response to trained objects: the magnitude of this training effect varied substantially across subregions of extrastriate cortex, with some showing a twofold increase in response to trained objects and others (including the right fusiform face area) showing no significant effect of training. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of training effects could not be predicted from the spatial distribution of either pretrained responses or face selectivity. Instead, training changed the spatial distribution of activity across the cortex. These findings support a dynamic view of the ventral visual pathway in which the cortical representation of an object category is continuously modulated by experience.

Task Performance and Analysis
Abstract: Using functional imaging, we investigated the effects of two different tasks on activation in the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Alternating blocks of intact and scrambled objects were presented. In one task, subjects responded when an object repeated (matching task). In a second task subjects silently named objects (naming task). Identical objects (tools, animals and letters) were presented for both tasks. A relative measure of the number of voxels activated in LOC in left and right hemispheres was calculated for each task across a range of thresholds. Also the effects of task demands on category specific areas in LOC were examined. The object matching task resulted in proportionally more activity in the right hemisphere. The object naming task resulted in proportionally more activity in the left hemisphere, most prominently in the anterior portion of LOC. Effectively, changing the task changed the lateralization of activation to intact objects in LOC. In contrast, changing the task did not change the lateralization of category-specific activations. The results suggest that there are task-related top-down influences on the activation of neural populations in LOC as a whole, but the lateralization of category-specific regions in LOC is independent of task demands and may reflect bottom-up processing.

Abstract: A large number of brain-damaged patients with heterogeneous category-specific deficits have been reported in literature. This has given rise to different theories concerning the processing of semantic knowledge. In this paper we report the case of K.C. who, after a bout of herpes simplex encephalitis, displayed a category-specific impairment restricted to the knowledge of animals, irrespective of input modality. K.C.'s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple bilateral antero-mesial and inferior temporal lesions. Although she was impaired for both the perceptual (visual and auditory) and functional/associative attributes of animals, she performed normally in an object-reality decision task involving pictures of animals and nonanimals. The dissociation between K.C.'s intact structural description system and her impaired semantic knowledge is interpreted according to hierarchical interactive theory (HIT), which assumes that conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized in separate but interactive multiple knowledge substores. K.C.'s results indicate that her access to a presemantic structural description system was intact so that her impairment on animal semantic knowledge arose later at a conceptual stage of the object recognition system. Furthermore, K.C.'s deficits indicate selective disruption of a special class of animate concepts within the broad category of living things, which seems best explained by the "domain-specific knowledge theory" proposed by Caramazza and Shelton.

Abstract: Theoretical models for lexical access to visual objects have been based mainly on adult data. To investigate the developmental aspects of object recognition and lexical access in children, a large-scale functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed in 283 normal children ages 5-18 using a word-picture matching paradigm in which children would match an aurally presented noun to one of two pictures (line drawings). Using group Independent Component Analysis (ICA), six task-related components were detected, including (a) the posterior superior temporal gyrus bilaterally; (b) the fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle occipital gyri bilaterally; (c) the dorsal aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, the left precuneus, the left superior/middle temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate; (d) the right medial fusiform gyrus; (e) a left-lateralized component including the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, medial frontal, and angular gyri, as well as the thalamus and the posterior cingulate; and (f) the ventral/anterior aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally. Increased activation associated with age was seen in the components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) for object recognition, and (c) and (f) likely associated with semantic maintenance and response selection. Increased activation associated with task performance was seen in components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) while decreased activation associated with task performance was seen in component (f) (ventral/anterior inferior frontal gyrus). The results corroborate the continued development of the ventral visual pathway throughout the developmental period.

Abstract: We investigated the influence of saccadic eye movements on the magnitude of functional MRI (fMRI) activation in brain regions known to participate in object and face perception. In separate runs, subjects viewed a static image of a uniform gray field, a face, or a flower. Every 500 ms a small fixation cross made a discrete jump within the image and subjects were required to make a saccade and fixate the cross at its new location. Each run consisted of alternating blocks in which the subject was guided to make small and large saccades. A comparison of large vs. small saccade blocks revealed robust activity in the oculomotor system, particularly within the frontal eye fields (FEF), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and superior colliculi regardless of the background image. Activity within portions of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) including the lingual and fusiform gyri was also modulated by saccades, but here saccade-related activity was strongly influenced by the background image. Activity within the VOTC was strongest when large saccadic eye movements were made over an image of a face or a flower compared to a uniform gray image. Of most interest was activity in the functionally predefined face-specific region of the fusiform gyrus, where large saccades made over a face increased activity, but where similar large saccades made over a flower or a uniform gray field did not increase activity. These results demonstrate the potentially confounding influence of uncontrolled eye movements for neuroimaging studies of face and object perception.

Abstract: The ability to identify and react to novelty within the environment is fundamental to survival. Computational models emphasize the potential role of the hippocampus in novelty detection, its unique anatomical circuitry making it ideally suited to act as a comparator between past and present experience. The hippocampus, therefore, is viewed to detect associative mismatches between what is expected based on retrieval of past experience and current sensory input. However, direct evidence that the human hippocampus performs such operations is lacking. We explored brain responses to novel sequences of objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while subjects performed an incidental target detection task. Our results demonstrate that hippocampal activation was maximal when prior predictions concerning which object would appear next in a sequence were violated by sensory reality. In so doing, we establish the biological reality of associative match-mismatch computations within the human hippocampus, a process widely held to play a cardinal role in novelty detection. Our results also suggest that the hippocampus may generate predictions about how future events will unfold, and critically detect when these expectancies are violated, even when task demands do not require it. The present study also offers broader insights into the nature of essential computations carried out by the hippocampus, which may also underpin its unique contribution to episodic memory.

Abstract: Bilateral redundant information often leads to improved detection performance compared to only unilateral input. This experiment investigates redundancy effects at the level of object processing in behavioral and functional imaging data. Subjects received different combinations of categorical information presented to both visual hemifields simultaneously. For pictures of faces as well as for pictures of buildings, response latencies were faster when two pictures from the same object category were presented compared to two pictures from different categories. This behavioral advantage was accompanied by increased activation in the respective object-selective areas, i.e. in the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) for pictures of faces and in the Parahippocampal Place Areas (PPAs) for pictures of buildings. These results suggest an involvement of visual object-selective areas in the behavioral redundancy gain.

Abstract: Prior knowledge regarding the possible identity of an object facilitates its recognition from a degraded visual input, though the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Previous work implicated ventral visual cortex but did not disambiguate whether activity-changes in these regions are causal to or merely reflect an effect of facilitated recognition. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study top-down influences on processing of gradually revealed objects, by preceding each object with a name that was congruent or incongruent with the object. Congruently primed objects were recognized earlier than incongruently primed, and this was paralleled by shifts in activation profiles for ventral visual, parietal, and prefrontal cortices. Prior to recognition, defined on a trial-by-trial basis, activity in ventral visual cortex rose gradually but equivalently for congruently and incongruently primed objects. In contrast, prerecognition activity was greater with congruent priming in lateral parietal, retrosplenial, and lateral prefrontal cortices, whereas functional coupling between parietal and ventral visual (and also left lateral prefrontal and parietal) cortices was enhanced in the same context. Thus, when controlling for recognition point and stimulus information, activity in ventral visual cortex mirrors recognition success, independent of condition. Facilitation by top-down cues involves lateral parietal cortex interacting with ventral visual areas, potentially explaining why parietal lesions can lead to deficits in recognizing degraded objects even in the context of top-down knowledge.

Abstract: Many lines of evidence suggest that individuals with schizophrenia suffer from face processing deficits. However, the specificity of these deficits and the neural dysfunction underlying them remain unclear. To address these questions, we evaluated the functional status of a critical region for face processing, the fusiform face area (FFA), in subjects with schizophrenia. Fourteen schizophrenia patients and 10 healthy control subjects participated in an fMRI experiment to determine the functional status of the FFA by viewing a series of faces and exemplars of other object categories, while completing a low-level task designed to verify their engagement with the stimuli. Behavioral performance and activation of the FFA were equivalent between groups. Thirteen of 14 patients and all control subjects displayed FFA activation. Furthermore, the degree of FFA activation, as measured by FFA volume and magnitude of activity, was similar between groups. The FFA, a critical region in the neural system subserving the perceptual processing of faces, appears to be intact in schizophrenia. These results call into question the presence of a specific face processing deficit in schizophrenia.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly being used for neurosurgical planning. One potential application relates to identifying eloquent cortex in regions immediately adjacent to epileptogenic foci in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). While medial temporal structures, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, are typically removed during surgery, it is often difficult to determine whether nearby cortical regions in the anterolateral temporal lobe should be spared. An essential first step is to identify a method of activating these regions in healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to develop a site directed fMRI approach for evaluating functional status in the anterolateral temporal lobes. A picture-word matching task, with object category and level of abstraction factors, was used to characterize temporal lobe activation. Whole brain analysis at the group level confirmed the involvement of the temporal poles as well as adjacent superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri within a larger object recognition network. A region-of-interest analysis on the anterolateral temporal lobe demonstrated that activation varied across conditions and regions for individuals. Importantly, it was possible to detect activation in one or more conditions and/or regions for all individuals--demonstrating that it is possible to evaluate functional status. The findings provide the foundation for a novel fMRI approach in neurosurgical planning for TLE.

Abstract: Functional imaging studies have shown that the posterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) is involved in allocentric (world-centered) object and scene recognition. However, the putative role of the posterior PHG in egocentric (body-centered) spatial memory has received only limited systematic investigation. Thirty-one subjects with pharmacoresistant medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and temporal lobe removal were compared with 19 matched healthy control subjects on a virtual reality task affording the navigation in a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Lesions of the hippocampus and PHG of TLE subjects were determined by three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging volumetric assessment. The results indicate that TLE subjects with right-sided posterior PHG lesions were impaired on virtual maze acquisition when compared with controls and TLE subjects with anterior PHG lesions. Larger posterior PHG lesions were significantly related to stronger impairments in virtual maze performance. Our results point to a role of the right-sided posterior PHG for the representation and storage of egocentric information. Moreover, access to both allocentric and egocentric streams of spatial information may enable the posterior PHG to construct a global and comprehensive representation of spatial environments.

Abstract: The research of event-related oscillations is one of fast-growing fields in neuroscience. In this study, a theory of the "whole-brain-work," which can be useful for functional interpretation of brain oscillations, is presented together with its application to recognition of faces and facial expressions. Following results are summarized: (1) Mechanisms leading to the perception of the grandmother picture are manifested with parallel activations of neural assemblies in different cortical locations and as superposition of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Known and anonymous faces can be differentiated by means of oscillatory brain dynamics. Percepts cannot be localized in a given specific region. The differentiation of facial expression induces significant change in alpha and theta oscillation. (2) While the importance of fMRI in object recognition is clear, this method has low temporal resolution. Our results shows that multiple brain oscillations clearly differentiate the known and unknown faces with varied degrees of selective-responsiveness in a short time window between 0 and 800 ms, thus completing and implementing the analysis of percepts in the dynamic window and indicating a broader distribution at the cortex. (3) The presented evidence of selectively distributed multiple oscillations for differentiation of facial percepts is in conceptual accordance with the "selectively distributed processing" in neurocognitive networks of Goldman-Rakic, Fuster, and of Mesulam. The large-scale approach of several investigators is also confirmed with the new results. On facial stimuli, a given location can show a considerable selected activation, but the formation of percepts is manifested by multiple oscillations with differentiated weight in large neural populations. (4) The most important feature of the comparison of percepts of grandmother and anonymous faces is the existence of a variety of significant differences in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma responses between the anonymous and grandmother faces in frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital sites. (5) The brain response is a construct in a multi-dimensional state manifested by amplitudes of oscillatory responses, topological coordinates, and changes in the time axis following presentation of the percepts including delays and prolongations, coherence between locations. Only a new metrics embracing all these parameters can be representative for dynamics of functionality in the brain. The conceptual aspects of this new scope are explained in the presented theory.

Abstract: Expertise can increase working memory (WM) performance, but the cognitive and neural mechanisms of these improvements remain unclear. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which expertise acquisition is supported by tuning of occipitotemporal object representations and tuning of prefrontal and parietal networks that may support domain-specific WM skills. We trained subjects to become experts in a novel category of complex visual objects and examined brain activity while they performed a WM task with objects from the expert category and from an untrained category. Visual expertise training resulted in improved recognition of expert, compared with untrained objects, and this effect was eliminated in a behavioral experiment by stimulus inversion. These behavioral changes were accompanied by increased recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior parietal, and occipitotemporal cortices during WM encoding and maintenance. Across subjects, behavioral measures of expertise reliably predicted increased activation during maintenance of expert objects in all three regions. These neural expertise effects could not be attributed to differences in low-level stimulus characteristics between the two categories, familiarity with features of expert-domain objects, or familiarity with the WM task. These results are consistent with the idea that visual expertise improves WM performance through tuning of occipitotemporal object representations and through development of lateral prefrontal and posterior parietal networks that mediate the application of domain-specific mnemonic skills.

Abstract: One of the most fundamental functions of the visual system is to code the positions of objects. Most studies, especially those using fMRI, widely assume that the location of the peak retinotopic activity generated in the visual cortex by an object is the position assigned to that object-this is a simplified version of the local sign hypothesis. Here, we employed a novel technique to compare the pattern of responses to moving and stationary objects and found that the local sign hypothesis is false. By spatially correlating populations of voxel responses to different moving and stationary stimuli in different positions, we recovered the modulation transfer function for moving patterns. The results show that the pattern of responses to a moving object is best correlated with the response to a static object that is located behind the moving one. The pattern of responses across the visual cortex was able to distinguish object positions separated by about 0.25 deg visual angle, equivalent to approximately 0.25 mm cortical distance. We also found that the position assigned to a pattern is not simply dictated by the peak activity-the shape of the luminance envelope and the resulting shape of the population response, including the shape and skew in the response at the edges of the pattern, influences where the visual cortex assigns the object's position. Therefore, visually coded position is not conveyed by the peak but by the overall profile of activity.

Abstract: Natural objects provide partially redundant information to the brain through different sensory modalities. For example, voices and faces both give information about the speech content, age, and gender of a person. Thanks to this redundancy, multimodal recognition is fast, robust, and automatic. In unimodal perception, however, only part of the information about an object is available. Here, we addressed whether, even under conditions of unimodal sensory input, crossmodal neural circuits that have been shaped by previous associative learning become activated and underpin a performance benefit. We measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging before, while, and after participants learned to associate either sensory redundant stimuli, i.e. voices and faces, or arbitrary multimodal combinations, i.e. voices and written names, ring tones, and cell phones or brand names of these cell phones. After learning, participants were better at recognizing unimodal auditory voices that had been paired with faces than those paired with written names, and association of voices with faces resulted in an increased functional coupling between voice and face areas. No such effects were observed for ring tones that had been paired with cell phones or names. These findings demonstrate that brief exposure to ecologically valid and sensory redundant stimulus pairs, such as voices and faces, induces specific multisensory associations. Consistent with predictive coding theories, associative representations become thereafter available for unimodal perception and facilitate object recognition. These data suggest that for natural objects effective predictive signals can be generated across sensory systems and proceed by optimization of functional connectivity between specialized cortical sensory modules.

Abstract: This paper provides a new medical image segmentation algorithm using a deformable contour model, which integrates Fuzzy C-Means(FCM) Clustering technique and deformable contour model. An external fuzzy constrain is defined from the membership function value of FCM, which joins the external constrain of the deformable model and drives the deformable model towards the contour ideal edge of the object. Examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the approach on spinal MRI images and the results are encouraging.

Abstract: One of the strongest predictors of the speed with which adults can name a pictured object is the age at which the object and its name are first learned. Age of acquisition also predicts the retention or loss of individual words following brain damage in conditions like aphasia and Alzheimer's disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to reveal brain areas differentially involved in naming objects with early or late acquired names. A baseline task involved passive viewing of non-objects. The comparison between the silent object naming conditions (early and late) with baseline showed significant activation in frontal, parietal and mediotemporal regions bilaterally and in the lingual and fusiform gyri on the left. Direct comparison of early and late items identified clusters with significantly greater activation for early acquired items at the occipital poles (in the posterior parts of the middle occipital gyri) and at the left temporal pole. In contrast, the left middle occipital and fusiform gyri showed significantly greater activation for late than early acquired items. We propose that greater activation to early than late objects at the occipital poles and at the left temporal pole reflects the more detailed visual and semantic representations of early than late acquired items. We propose that greater activation to late than early objects in the left middle occipital and fusiform gyri occurs because those areas are involved in mapping visual onto semantic representations, which is more difficult, and demands more resource, for late than for early items.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain novel information depends on a system of structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) including the hippocampus and the surrounding entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. Damage to these structures produces profound memory deficits; however, the unique contribution to memory of each of these structures remains unclear. Here we have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices show differential memory-related activity. Based on the distinct patterns of cortical input to these two areas, we reasoned that these structures might show differential activity for spatial and object recognition memory. In each of 11 subjects, we found that the perirhinal cortex was active during both spatial and object memory encoding, while the anterior parahippocampal cortex was active only during spatial encoding. These data support the idea that MTL structures make distinct contributions to recognition memory performance.

Abstract: The lateral occipital complex (LOC), a cortical region critical for human object recognition, has been shown to primarily code the shape, rather than the surface properties, of an object. But what aspects of shape? Using an fMRI-adaptation (fMRI-a) paradigm in which subjects judged whether two contour-deleted images of objects were the same or different exemplars, virtually all the adaptation in LOC [especially in LOC's most anterior portion (pFs)] could be attributed to repetition of the parts, almost none to the repetition of local image features, such as lines or vertices, templates, or basic- or subordinate-level concepts of the object. These results support the hypothesis that the neural representation of shape in LOC is an intermediate one, encoding the parts of an object.

Abstract: Evidence from functional neuroimaging of the human brain indicates that information about salient properties of an object-such as what it looks like, how it moves, and how it is used-is stored in sensory and motor systems active when that information was acquired. As a result, object concepts belonging to different categories like animals and tools are represented in partially distinct, sensory- and motor property-based neural networks. This suggests that object concepts are not explicitly represented, but rather emerge from weighted activity within property-based brain regions. However, some property-based regions seem to show a categorical organization, thus providing evidence consistent with category-based, domain-specific formulations as well.

Abstract: A number of lines of evidence suggest that computation of hand posture differs for object grasping as compared to functional object use. Hand shaping for grasping appears to rely strongly upon calculations of current object location and volume, whereas hand shaping for object use additionally requires access to stored knowledge about the skilled manipulation specific to a given object. In addition, the particular hand postures employed for functional object use may be either prehensile (clenching, pinching) or non-prehensile (e.g., palming, poking), in contrast to the prehensile postures that are obligatory for grasping. In this fMRI study, we assessed the hypothesis that a left-hemisphere-lateralized system including the inferior parietal lobe is specifically recruited for the computation and recognition of hand postures for functional object use. Fifteen subjects viewed pictures of manipulable objects and determined whether they would be grasped with a pinch or clench (Grasp condition), functionally used with a pinch or clench (Prehensile Use condition), or functionally used with a palm or poke hand posture (Non-prehensile Use condition). Despite the fact that the conditions were equated for behavioral difficulty, significantly greater activations were observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in Non-prehensile Use trials as compared to Grasp trials. Comparison of Non-prehensile Use and Prehensile Use activations revealed significant differences only in the left IPL. These data confirm the importance of the left IPL in storing knowledge of hand postures for functional object use, and have implications for understanding the interaction of dorsal and ventral visual processing systems.

Abstract: In normal viewing, the visual system effortlessly assigns approximately constant attributes of color and shape to perceived objects. A fundamental component of this process is the compensation for illuminant variations and intervening media to recover reflectance properties of natural surfaces. We exploited the phenomenon of transparency perception to explore the cortical regions implicated in such processes, using fMRI. By manipulating the coherence of local color differences around a region in an image, we interfered with their global perceptual integration and thereby modified whether the region appeared transparent or not. We found the major cortical activation due to global integration of local color differences to be in the anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus. Regions differentially activated by chromatic versus achromatic geometric patterns showed no significant differential response related to the coherence/incoherence of local color differences. The results link the integration of local color differences in the extraction of a transparent layer with sites activated by object-related properties of an image.

Abstract: The processing of words and pictures representing actions and objects was tested in 21 aphasic patients and 20 healthy controls across three word production tasks: picture-naming (PN), single word reading (WR) and word repetition (WRP). Analysis 1 targeted task and lexical category (noun-verb), revealing worse performance on PN and verb items for both patients and control participants. For Analysis 2 we used data collected in a concurrent gesture norming study to re-categorize the noun-verb items along hand imagery parameters (i.e., objects that can/cannot be manipulated and actions which do/do not involve fine hand movements). Here, patients displayed relative difficulty with the 'manipulable' items, while controls displayed the opposite pattern. Therefore, whereas the noun-verb distinction resulted simply in lower verb accuracy across groups, the 'manipulability' distinction revealed a 'double-dissociation' between patients and control participants. These results carry implications for theories of embodiment, lexico-semantic dissociations, and the organization of meaning in the brain.

Abstract: Similar "what/where" functional segregations have been proposed for both visual and auditory cortical processing. In this fMRI study, we investigated if the same segregation exists in the crossmodal domain, when visual and auditory stimuli have to be matched in order to perform either a recognition or a localization task. Recent neuroimaging research highlighted the contribution of different heteromodal cortical regions during various forms of crossmodal binding. Interestingly, crossmodal effects during audiovisual speech and object recognition have been found in the superior temporal sulcus, while crossmodal effects during the execution of spatial tasks have been found over the intraparietal sulcus, suggesting an underlying "what/where" segregation. In order to directly compare the specific involvement of these two heteromodal regions, we scanned ten male right-handed subjects during the execution of two crossmodal matching tasks. Participants were simultaneously presented with a picture and an environmental sound, coming from either the same or the opposite hemifield and representing either the same or a different object. The two tasks required a manual YES/NO response respectively about location or semantic matching of the presented stimuli. Both group and individual subject analysis were performed. Task-related differences in BOLD response were observed in the right intraparietal sulcus and in the left superior temporal sulcus, providing a direct confirmation of the "what-where" functional segregation in the crossmodal audiovisual domain.

Abstract: Amblyopia is a visual disorder starting at early childhood and characterized by reduced visual acuity not of optical origin or due to any eye disease. One expression of such an anomalous early visual experience is abnormal foveal vision. In a previous fMRI study, faces that were presented to amblyopic eyes evoked little response compared to houses in high-order visual areas. Patients also demonstrated reduced recognition of facial expression, raising the possibility that these face-selective abnormalities are related to foveal vision deficit. Whether this deficit originates in low-level processing or is mediated by compromised activation in high-order visual areas is unresolved. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we explored the impact of amblyopia on the representation of object images presented in foveally biased central versus peripheral retinotopic eccentricities through manipulation of object size. Small and large pictures were correlated to visual acuities of 6/6 and 6/60, respectively. In low-level visual areas, the amblyopic eye showed significantly reduced activation for centrally placed, small pictures than the sound eye, while activation to large pictures was only slightly reduced. Similarly, in high-order visual areas, the amblyopic eye showed marked reduction in activation in the fusiform gyrus, with normal activation in the collateral sulcus. The center/periphery size-related amblyopic outcomes of this study support a "bottom-up" nature of the center-periphery effect observed in high-order visual areas. Taken together, these findings point to the regional extent and functional selectivity of fovea-related cortical reorganization that is related to abnormal visual development of one eye.

Abstract: We review the progress made in the field of object recognition over the past two decades. Structural-description models, making their appearance in the early 1980s, inspired a wealth of empirical research. Moving to the 1990s, psychophysical evidence for view-based accounts of recognition challenged some of the fundamental assumptions of structural-description theories. The 1990s also saw increased interest in the neurophysiological study of high-level visual cortex, the results of which provide some constraints on how objects may be represented. By 2000, neuroimaging arose as a viable means for connecting neurons to behavior. One of the most striking fMRI results has been category selectivity, which provided further constraints for models of object recognition. Despite this progress, the field is still faced with the challenge of developing a comprehensive theory that integrates this ever-increasing body of results and explains how we perceive and recognize objects.

Abstract: A region in ventral human cortex (fusiform face area, FFA) thought to be important for face perception responds strongly to faces and less strongly to nonface objects. This pattern of response may reflect a uniform face-selective neural population or activity averaged across populations with heterogeneous selectivity. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we found that the FFA has a reliable heterogeneous structure: localized subregions within the FFA highly selective to faces are spatially interdigitated with localized subregions highly selective to different object categories. We found a preponderance of face-selective responses in the FFA, but no difference in selectivity to faces compared to nonfaces. Thus, standard fMRI of the FFA reflects averaging of heterogeneous highly selective neural populations of differing sizes, rather than higher selectivity to faces. These results suggest that visual processing in this region is not exclusive to faces. Overall, our approach provides a framework for understanding the fine-scale structure of neural representations in the human brain.

Abstract: OBJECT: The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies in the classification of brain tumors in terms of both cell type and grade of malignancy. METHODS: The authors retrospectively assessed the correlation between neuroimaging classifications and histopathological diagnoses by using multicenter database records from 393 patients with brain tumors. An ontology was devised to establish diagnostic agreement. Each tumor category was compared with the corresponding histopathological diagnoses by dichotomization. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs, respectively), and the Wilson 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each were calculated. In routine reporting of MR imaging examinations, tumor types and grades were classified with a high specificity (85.2-100%); sensitivity varied, depending on the tumor type and grade, alone or in combination. The recognition of broad diagnostic categories (neuroepithelial or meningeal lesions) was highly sensitive, whereas when both detailed type and grade were considered, sensitivity diverged, being highest in low-grade meningioma (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 96.2-100.0%) and lowest in high-grade meningioma (sensitivity 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0-65.8%) and low-grade oligodendroglioma (sensitivity 15%, 95% CI 5.2-36.0%). In neuroepithelial tumors, sensitivity was inversely related to the precision in reporting of grade and cellular origin; "glioma" was a frequent neuroimaging classification associated with higher sensitivity in the corresponding category. The PPVs varied among categories, in general being greater than their prevalence in this dataset. The NPV was high in all categories (69.8-100%). CONCLUSIONS: The PPVs and NPVs provided in this study may be used as estimates of posttest probabilities of diagnostic accuracy using MR imaging. This study targets the need for noninvasively increasing sensitivity in categorizing most brain tumor types while retaining high specificity, especially in the differentiation of high- and low-grade glial tumor classes.

Abstract: Segmentation of left ventricles is one of the important research topics in cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The segmentation precision influences the authenticity of ventricular motion reconstruction. In left ventricle MR images, the weak and broken boundary increases the difficulty of segmenting the outer contour precisely. In this paper, we present an improved shape statistics variational approach for the outer contour segmentation of left ventricle MR images. We use the Mumford-Shah model in an object feature space and incorporate the shape statistics and an edge image to the variational framework. The introduction of shape statistics can improve the segmentation with broken boundaries. The edge image can enhance the weak boundary and thus improve the segmentation precision. The generation of the object feature image, which has homogenous "intensities" in the left ventricle, facilitates the application of the Mumford-Shah model. A comparison of mean absolute distance analysis between different contours generated with our algorithm and that generated by hand demonstrated that our method can achieve a higher segmentation precision and a better stability than various approaches. It is a semiautomatic way for the segmentation of the outer contour of the left ventricle in clinical applications.

Abstract: Prevailing theory holds that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subserves declarative memory exclusively, whereas nondeclarative memory is independent of this brain region. Recent studies in patients with amnesia, however, have shown that performance on declarative memory tasks may not always be dependent on a single MTL memory system, instead highlighting the critical role of anatomically distinct structures in processing different stimulus types. In particular, the hippocampus has been implicated in spatial memory, whereas perirhinal cortex seems critical for object memory. To assess whether stimulus type would also be a key dimension in nondeclarative memory, patients with selective hippocampal lesions were tested on simple categorization and perceptual learning of faces and virtual reality scenes. The patients demonstrated preserved categorization and perceptual learning of faces but abnormal performance when the stimuli to be discriminated were virtual reality scenes. These findings imply that stimulus type may be a more critical predictor of performance on memory tasks (declarative and nondeclarative) than previously thought. They also suggest that reports of good nondeclarative memory after MTL damage may, in some cases, simply reflect the use of stimuli that fail to tap the processes dependent on structures in this region, such as spatial processing in the case of the hippocampus.

Abstract: The relationship between neural activity and object perception has received considerable attention using stimulus manipulations such as masking or dichoptic presentation. Here we investigate the same problem by occluding objects with an opaque screen that acts to dissociate the direct perception of the object from the awareness of its presence. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity when subjects viewed objects (faces and houses) that underwent occlusion and found that the response of the majority of the fusiform face area (FFA) and lateral occipital cortex is the same whether the object is visible or occluded. This suggests that when objects are directly viewed, activity within object-selective regions may reflect the awareness of presence, not the direct perception, of the object. Additionally, we identify a region of premotor cortex that is selectively activated by occlusion of either object type, suggesting its generic involvement with processing occluded objects.

Abstract: Contour curvature (CC) is a vital cue for the analysis of both form and motion. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we localized the neural correlates of CC for the processing and perception of rotational motion. We found that the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in retinotopic area V3A and possibly also lateral occipital cortex (LOC) varied parametrically with the degree of CC. Control experiments ruled out the possibility that these modulations resulted from either changes in the area of the stimuli, the velocity with which contour elements were actually translating, or perceived angular velocity. We conclude that neurons within V3A and perhaps also LOC process continuously moving CC as a trackable feature. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that V3A contains neural populations that process trackable form features such as CC, not to solve the "ventral problem" of determining object shape but in order to solve the "dorsal problem" of what is going where.

Abstract: How are objects represented in the brain? Two facets of this question are currently under investigation. First, are objects represented by activity in a relatively small number of neurons that are each selective for the shape or identity of a specific object (a 'sparse code'), or are they represented by a pattern of activity across a large number of less selective neurons (a 'population code')? Second, how are the neurons that code for an object distributed across the cortex: are they clustered together in patches, or are they scattered widely across the cortex? The results from neurophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies are beginning to provide preliminary answers to both questions.

Abstract: In the present study brain laterality, hemispheric communication, and mental rotation performance were examined. A sample of 33 women were tested for a possible linear relationship of testosterone level and mental rotation with structural background of the brain. Subjects with a smaller splenial area of corpus callosum tended to have lower levels of testosterone (r =.37, p<.05). However, there were no significant differences in mean scores of mental rotation of object and hand between groups with high and low levels of testosterone. There was a significant difference in relative size of the 6th area (slice) of the corpus callosum between groups with good and poor scores on mental rotation of an object and also in relative size of the 4th and 5th slices of the corpus callosum between groups on mental rotation of the hand. The good and poor scorers' show different relations with the measures of the corpus. The mental rotation of hand was associated with the parietal areas of the corpus callosum, while the mental rotation of object was associated only with the occipital area. These observations suggest that higher testosterone levels may be associated with a larger splenial area, which represents an important connection between the parieto-occipitocortical areas involved in activation of mental images. Further srudy is encouraged.

Abstract: The spatial representation in the human ventral object-related areas (i.e., the lateral occipital complex [LOC]) is currently unknown. It seems plausible, however, that it would diverge from the strict retinotopic mapping (characteristic of V1) to a more invariant coordinate frame, thereby allowing for reliable object recognition in the face of eye, head, or body movement. To study this, we compared the fMRI activation in LOC when object displacement was limited to either the retina or the screen by manipulating eye position and object locations. We found clear adaptation in LOC when the object's screen position was fixed, regardless of the object's retinal position. Furthermore, we found significantly greater activation in LOC in the hemisphere contralateral to the object's screen position, although the visual task was constructed in a way that the objects were present equally often on each of the 2 retinal hemifields. Together, these results indicate that a sizeable fraction of the neurons in LOC may have head-based receptive fields. Such an extraretinal representation may be useful for maintenance of object coherence across saccadic eye movements, which are an integral part of natural vision.

Abstract: In our daily lives, recognizing a familiar object is an effortless and seemingly instantaneous process. Our knowledge of how the brain accomplished this formidable task, however, is quite limited. The present study takes a holistic approach to examining the neural processes that underlie recognition memory. A unique paradigm, in which visual information about the identity of a person or word is slowly titrated to human observers during a functional imaging session, is employed to uncover the dynamics of the visual recognition in the brain. The results of study reveal multiple unique stages in visual recognition that can be dissociated from one another based on temporal asynchronies and hemodynamic response characteristics.

Abstract: Using fMR adaptation, we studied the effects of aging on the neural processing of passively viewed naturalistic pictures composed of a prominent object against a background scene. Spatially distinct neural regions showing specific patterns of adaptation to objects, background scenes, and contextual integration (binding) were identified in young adults. Older adults did not show adaptation responses corresponding to binding in the medial-temporal areas. They also showed an adaptation deficit for objects whereby their lateral occipital complex (LOC) did not adapt to repeated objects in the context of a changing background. The LOC could be activated, however, when objects were presented without a background. Moreover, the adaptation deficit for objects viewed against backgrounds was reversed when elderly subjects were asked to attend to objects while viewing these complex pictures. These findings suggest that the elderly have difficulty with simultaneous processing of objects and backgrounds that, in turn, could contribute to deficient contextual binding.

Abstract: Traditional segmentation techniques do not quite meet the challenges posed by inherently fuzzy medical images. Image segmentation based on fuzzy connectedness addresses this problem by attempting to capture both closeness, based on characteristic intensity, and "hanging togetherness," based on intensity homogeneity, of image elements to the target object. This paper presents a modification and extension of previously published image segmentation algorithms based on fuzzy connectedness, which is computed as a linear combination of an object-feature-based and a homogeneity-based component using fixed weights. We provide a method, called fuzzy connectedness using dynamic weights (DyW), to introduce directional sensitivity to the homogeneity-based component and to dynamically adjust the linear weights in the functional form of fuzzy connectedness. Dynamic computation of the weights relieves the user of the exhaustive search process to find the best combination of weights suited to a particular application. This is critical in applications such as analysis of cardiac cine magnetic resonance (MR) images, where the optimal combination of affinity component weights can vary for each slice, each phase, and each subject, in spite of data being acquired from the same MR scanner with identical protocols. We present selected results of applying DyW to segment phantom images and actual MR, computed tomography, and infrared data. The accuracy of DyW is assessed by comparing it to two different formulations of fuzzy connectedness. Our method consistently achieves accuracy of more than 99.15% for a range of image complexities: contrast 5%-65%, noise-to-contrast ratio of 6%-18%, and bias field of four types with maximum gain factor of up to 10%.

Abstract: Successful navigation is facilitated by the presence of landmarks. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence indicated that the human parahippocampal gyrus automatically distinguishes between landmarks placed at navigationally relevant (decision points) and irrelevant locations (nondecision points). This storage of navigational relevance can provide a neural mechanism underlying successful navigation. However, an efficient wayfinding mechanism requires that important spatial information is learned quickly and maintained over time. The present study investigates whether the representation of navigational relevance is modulated by time and practice. Participants learned 2 film sequences through virtual mazes containing objects at decision and at nondecision points. One maze was shown one time, and the other maze was shown 3 times. Twenty-four hours after study, event-related fMRI data were acquired during recognition of the objects. The results showed that activity in the parahippocampal gyrus was increased for objects previously placed at decision points as compared with objects placed at nondecision points. The decision point effect was not modulated by the number of exposures to the mazes and independent of explicit memory functions. These findings suggest a persistent representation of navigationally relevant information, which is stable after only one exposure to an environment. These rapidly induced and long-lasting changes in object representation provide a basis for successful wayfinding.

Abstract: The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine cortical specialization for letter processing. We assessed whether brain regions that were involved in letter processing exhibited domain-specific and/or mandatory responses, following Fodor's definition of properties of modular systems (Fodor, J.A., 1983. The Modularity of Mind. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.). Domain-specificity was operationalized as selective, or exclusive, activation for letters relative to object and visual noise processing and a baseline fixation task. Mandatory processing was operationalized as selective activation for letters during both a silent naming and a perceptual matching task. In addition to these operational definitions, other operational definitions of selectivity for letter processing discussed by [Pernet, C., Celsis, P., Demonet, J., 2005. Selective response to letter categorization within the left fusiform gyrus. NeuroImage 28, 738-744] were applied to the data. Although the left fusiform gyrus showed a specialized response to letters using the definition of selectivity put forth by [Pernet, C., Celsis, P., Demonet, J., 2005. Selective response to letter categorization within the left fusiform gyrus. NeuroImage 28, 738-744], this region did not exhibit specialization for letters according to our more conservative definition of selectivity. Instead, this region showed equivalent activation by letters and objects in both the naming and matching tasks. Hence, the left fusiform gyrus does not exhibit domain-specific or mandatory processing but may reflect a shared input system for both stimulus types. The left insula and some portions of the left inferior parietal lobule, however, did show a domain-specific response for letter naming but not for letter matching. These regions likely subserve some linguistically oriented cognitive process that is unique to letters, such as grapheme-to-phoneme translation or retrieval of phonological codes for letter names. Hence, cortical specialization for letters emerged in the naming task in some peri-sylvian language related cortices, but not in occipito-temporal cortex. Given that the domain-specific response for letters in left peri-sylvian regions was only present in the naming task, these regions do not process letters in a mandatory fashion, but are instead modulated by the linguistic nature of the task.

Abstract: Primate studies suggest the auditory cortex is organized in at least two anatomically and functionally separate pathways: a ventral pathway specializing in object recognition and a dorsal pathway specializing in object localization. The current experiment assesses the validity of this model in human listeners using fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of spatial and non-spatial temporal pattern information. Targets were differentiated from non-targets on the basis of two levels of pitch information (present vs. absent, fixed vs. varying) and two levels of spatial information (compact vs. diffuse sound source, fixed vs. varying location) in a factorial design. Analyses revealed spatially separate responses to spatial and non-spatial temporal information. The main activation associated with pitch occurred predominantly in Heschl's gyrus (HG) and planum polare, while that associated with changing sound source location occurred posterior to HG, in planum temporale (PT). Activation common to both pitch and changing spatial location was located bilaterally in anterior PT. Apart from this small region of overlap, our data support the anatomical and functional segregation of 'what' and 'where' in human non-primary auditory cortex. Our results also highlight a distinction in the sensitivity of anterior and posterior fields of PT to non-spatial information and specify the type of spatial information that is coded within early areas of the spatial processing stream.

Abstract: Since the brain may engage different neuronal systems for a single behavioral goal, activation may show intersubject variability expressed in the systematic recruitment of multiple distinct networks. We apply a principal component analysis (PCA) to activation over task conditions and subjects to reveal cortical networks that may underlie this intersubject variability. Normal subjects were presented with novel meaningless objects, which appeared in personally familiar or unfamiliar places. During a subsequent, event-related functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, each subject was presented with learned or novel objects in isolation and performed a learned/novel judgment. Recollection of places was not essential for the task, and may exhibit large intersubject variations. The right posterodorsal posterior cingulate cortex (pPCC) and left retrosplenial cortex, whose involvement in place-recognition has been previously established, were selected as regions of interest for the PCA. Neural responses to objects associated with familiar relative to unfamiliar places in pPCC, but not in the retrosplenial cortex, were negatively correlated with task-related activation (common over all objects) in the right anterolateral prefrontal cortex and the left intraparietal sulcus. The latter areas have been implicated previously in cognitive control and object recognition, respectively. These results suggest right prefrontal control over neural processes both in the left parietal cortex, related to object-recognition (enhancement), and pPCC, related to nonessential recollection of place-memory (suppression), but not in the retrosplenial cortex, related to the sense of familiarity. This analysis revealed an important aspect of functional anatomy that was not detectable using a conventional analysis of average activations.

Abstract: OBJECT: Cases of infected dermal sinus are scarce and detailed surgical anatomical descriptions are hardly found in literature. The clinical, radiological, and surgical findings in four cases of an infected dermal sinus located at the lower spine are presented to elucidate the pathological anatomical configuration. CLINICAL MATERIAL: The first case showed two dermal sinuses with a parallel course extra- and intradurally, ending in a confluence of cavities connected to the conus. In this case, as well as in the fourth case, the signs and symptoms were those of meningitis. The second case presented with meningitis and a subdural empyema, while the third case presented with an intradermoid-intramedullary abscess at the junction between the DS and the conus. This child probably showed signs and symptoms of conus involvement as early as during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The anatomy of the nervous elements in this congenital anomaly is heavily disturbed, more particularly in case of infection, due to extensive arachnoidal scarring. The latter renders dissection laborious and recognition of anatomical details difficult, resulting in complete excision of a dermal sinus in less than half of the cases. Despite their variability in presentation, most cases of an infected dermal sinus show similar characteristic features.

Abstract: Knowledge of objects in the world is stored in our brains as rich, multimodal representations. Because the neural pathways that process this diverse sensory information are largely anatomically distinct, a fundamental challenge to cognitive neuroscience is to explain how the brain binds the different sensory features that comprise an object to form meaningful, multimodal object representations. Studies with nonhuman primates suggest that a structure at the culmination of the object recognition system (the perirhinal cortex) performs this critical function. In contrast, human neuroimaging studies implicate the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The results of the functional MRI study reported here resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that both pSTS and the perirhinal cortex contribute to crossmodal binding in humans, but in different ways. Significantly, only perirhinal cortex activity is modulated by meaning variables (e.g., semantic congruency and semantic category), suggesting that these two regions play complementary functional roles, with pSTS acting as a presemantic, heteromodal region for crossmodal perceptual features, and perirhinal cortex integrating these features into higher-level conceptual representations. This interpretation is supported by the results of our behavioral study: Patients with lesions, including the perirhinal cortex, but not patients with damage restricted to frontal cortex, were impaired on the same crossmodal integration task, and their performance was significantly influenced by the same semantic factors, mirroring the functional MRI findings. These results integrate nonhuman and human primate research by providing converging evidence that human perirhinal cortex is also critically involved in processing meaningful aspects of multimodal object representations.

Abstract: We present here a new method for correcting the topology of objects segmented from medical images. Whereas previous techniques alter a surface obtained from the hard segmentation of the object, our technique works directly in the image domain, propagating the topology for all isosurfaces of the object. From an analysis of topological changes and critical points in implicit surfaces, we introduce a topology progagation algorithm that enforces any desired topology using a fast marching technique. Compared to previous topology correction techniques, the method successfully corrects topology while effecting fewer changes to the original volume.

Abstract: Recently there has been a great deal of interest in algorithms for constructing low-dimensional feature-space embeddings of high dimensional data sets in order to visualize inter- and intra-class relationships. In this paper we present a novel application of graph embedding in improving the accuracy of supervised classification schemes, especially in cases where object class labels cannot be reliably ascertained. By refining the initial training set of class labels we seek to improve the prior class distributions and thus classification accuracy. We also present a novel way of visualizing the class embeddings which makes it easy to appreciate inter-class relationships and to infer the presence of new classes which were not part of the original classification. We demonstrate the utility of the method in detecting prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution MRI.

Abstract: We carried out 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments to investigate the cortical mechanisms underlying the contribution of form and surface properties to object recognition. In experiment 1, participants performed same-different judgments in separate blocks of trials on pairs of unfamiliar "nonsense" objects on the basis of their form, surface properties (i.e., both color and texture), or orientation. Attention to form activated the lateral occipital (LO) area, whereas attention to surface properties activated the collateral sulcus (CoS) and the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). In experiment 2, participants were required to make same-different judgments on the basis of texture, color, or form. Again attention to form activated area LO, whereas attention to texture activated regions in the IOG and the CoS, as well as regions in the lingual sulcus and the inferior temporal sulcus. Within these last 4 regions, activation associated with texture was higher than activation associated with color. No color-specific cortical areas were identified in these regions, although parts of V1 and the cuneus yielded higher activation for color as opposed to texture. These results suggest that there are separate form and surface-property pathways in extrastriate cortex. The extraction of information about an object's color seems to occur relatively early in visual analysis as compared with the extraction of surface texture, perhaps because the latter requires more complex computations.

Abstract: The left hemispheric dominance for complex motor behavior is undisputed. Clinical observations of complex motor deficits in patients with right hemispheric lesions, however, suggest an additional contribution of the right hemisphere to higher motor control. We assessed, using functional MRI (fMRI), which brain regions are implicated in processing the spatial aspects of complex, object-related actions. Using a blocked, factorial design, 17 healthy volunteers were asked to detect either spatial or sequential errors (factor ERROR) in complex activities of daily living, presented as video sequences with the appropriate object(s) or as pantomimes (factor STIMULUS). Observing complex actions (irrespective of stimulus type) activated a bilateral frontoparietal network. Observing actions with objects (relative to pantomimes) differentially increased neural activity in the fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital cortex bilaterally. Observing pantomimes, i.e., the same actions but without any object, differentially activated right prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, the precuneus, and left cerebellum. The left cingulate cortex was differentially activated when subjects assessed the sequencing of actions. By contrast, assessing the spatial configuration of complex actions differentially increased neural activity in right posterior parietal cortex. A significant interaction of ERROR and STIMULUS was revealed for the right inferior parietal cortex only. These findings suggest a specific role of the right hemisphere, especially of right posterior parietal cortex, in processing spatial aspects of complex actions and thus provide a physiological basis for the observed apraxic motor deficits in patients with right hemispheric damage.

Abstract: The human visual system possesses a remarkable ability to reconstruct the shape of an object that is partly occluded by an interposed surface. Behavioral results suggest that, under some circumstances, this perceptual process (termed amodal completion) progresses from an initial representation of local image features to a completed representation of a shape that may include features that are not explicitly present in the retinal image. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that the completed surface is represented in early visual cortical areas. We used fMRI adaptation, combined with brief, masked exposures, to track the amodal completion process as it unfolds in early visual cortical regions. We report evidence for an evolution of the neural representation from the image-based feature representation to the completed representation. Our method offers the possibility of measuring changes in cortical activity using fMRI over a time scale of a few hundred milliseconds.

Abstract: Recently, shape matching in three dimensions (3-D) has been gaining importance in a wide variety of fields such as computer graphics, computer vision, medicine, and biology, with applications such as object recognition, medical diagnosis, and quantitative morphological analysis of biological operations. Automatic shape matching techniques developed in the field of computer graphics handle object surfaces, but ignore intensities of inner voxels. In biology and medical imaging, voxel intensities obtained by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imagery (MRI), and confocal microscopes are important to determine point correspondences. Nevertheless, most biomedical volume matching techniques require human interactions, and automatic methods assume matched objects to have very similar shapes so as to avoid combinatorial explosions of point. This article is aimed at decreasing the gap between the two fields. The proposed method automatically finds dense point correspondences between two grayscale volumes; i.e., finds a correspondent in the second volume for every voxel in the first volume, based on the voxel intensities. Mutiresolutional pyramids are introduced to reduce computational load and handle highly plastic objects. We calculate the average shape of a set of similar objects and give a measure of plasticity to compare them. Matching results can also be used to generate intermediate volumes for morphing. We use various data to validate the effectiveness of our method: we calculate the average shape and plasticity of a set of fly brain cells, and we also match a human skull and an orangutan skull.

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying object recognition is one of the fundamental challenges of visual neuroscience. While neurophysiology experiments have provided evidence for a "simple-to-complex" processing model based on a hierarchy of increasingly complex image features, behavioral and fMRI studies of face processing have been interpreted as incompatible with this account. We present a neurophysiologically plausible, feature-based model that quantitatively accounts for face discrimination characteristics, including face inversion and "configural" effects. The model predicts that face discrimination is based on a sparse representation of units selective for face shapes, without the need to postulate additional, "face-specific" mechanisms. We derive and test predictions that quantitatively link model FFA face neuron tuning, neural adaptation measured in an fMRI rapid adaptation paradigm, and face discrimination performance. The experimental data are in excellent agreement with the model prediction that discrimination performance should asymptote as faces become dissimilar enough to activate different neuronal populations.

Abstract: In a comprehensive series of experiments that combine neural modeling, behavioral data, and fMRI, Jiang et al. (this issue of Neuron) advance a general object and face classification model, based on a feedforward shape-detector architecture. The model accounts for configural face processing as well as for shape-based fMRI activation in the fusiform face area (FFA).

Abstract: Developmental prosopagnosia is characterized by severely impaired face recognition. Individuals with this disorder, which often runs in families, have no history of brain damage and intact early visual processing systems. Recent research has also demonstrated that many developmental prosopagnosics have normal or relatively good object recognition, indicating that their impairments are not the result of deficits to a unitary visual recognition mechanism. To investigate the nature of the impaired mechanisms, extensive testing was done on an individual with especially pure face processing deficits. The results ruled out all extant explanations of prosopagnosia except one that proposed that faces are recognized by a content-specific face processing mechanism. fMRI and MEG studies show that there are a variety of neural profiles in developmental prosopagnosia, which is consistent with behavioral studies demonstrating that it is a heterogeneous disorder.

Abstract: The capability of the adult primate visual system for rapid and accurate recognition of targets in cluttered, natural scenes far surpasses the abilities of state-of-the-art artificial vision systems. Understanding this capability remains a fundamental challenge in visual neuroscience. Recent experimental evidence suggests that adaptive coding strategies facilitated by underlying neural plasticity enable the adult brain to learn from visual experience and shape its ability to integrate and recognize coherent visual objects.

Abstract: The human visual system has a remarkable ability to successfully operate under a variety of challenging viewing conditions. For example, our object-recognition capabilities are largely unaffected by low-contrast (e.g., foggy) environments. The basis for this ability appears to be reflected in the neural responses in higher cortical visual areas that have been characterized as being invariant to changes in luminance contrast: neurons in these areas respond nearly equally to low-contrast as compared to high-contrast stimuli. This response pattern is fundamentally different than that observed in earlier visual areas such as primary visual cortex (V1), which is highly dependent on contrast. How this invariance is achieved in higher visual areas is largely unknown. We hypothesized that directed spatial attention is an important prerequisite of the contrast-invariant responses in higher visual areas and tested this with functional MRI (fMRI) while subjects directed their attention either toward or away from contrast-varying shape stimuli. We found that in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), a visual area important for processing shape information, attention changes the form of the contrast response function (CRF). By directing attention away from the shape stimuli, the CRF in the LOC was similar to that measured in V1. We describe a number of mechanisms that could account for this important function of attention.

Abstract: Participants indicated whether two sequentially presented objects were of the same category (between-task) or were identical (within-task). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine cortical activation during the tasks. During the between-task, the left inferior parietal lobule was more activated than the right. During the within-task, the right superior occipital gyrus was more activated than the left. These results suggest that a hemispheric asymmetry, corresponding to spatial relation processing, exists for recognition of objects.

Abstract: The neural substrates underlying speech perception are still not well understood. Previously, we found dissociation of speech and nonspeech processing at the earliest cortical level (AI), using speech and nonspeech complexity dimensions. Acoustic differences between speech and nonspeech stimuli in imaging studies, however, confound the search for linguistic-phonetic regions. Presently, we used sinewave speech (SWsp) and nonspeech (SWnon), which replace speech formants with sinewave tones, in order to match acoustic spectral and temporal complexity while contrasting phonetics. Chord progressions (CP) were used to remove the effects of auditory coherence and object processing. Twelve normal RH volunteers were scanned with fMRI while listening to SWsp, SWnon, CP, and a baseline condition arranged in blocks. Only two brain regions, in bilateral superior temporal sulcus, extending more posteriorly on the left, were found to prefer the SWsp condition after accounting for acoustic modulation and coherence effects. Two regions responded preferentially to the more frequency-modulated stimuli, including one that overlapped the right temporal phonetic area and another in the left angular gyrus far from the phonetic area. These findings are proposed to form the basis for the two subtypes of auditory word deafness. Several brain regions, including auditory and non-auditory areas, preferred the coherent auditory stimuli and are likely involved in auditory object recognition. The design of the current study allowed for separation of acoustic spectrotemporal, object recognition, and phonetic effects resulting in distinct and overlapping components.

Abstract: Using a declarative memory paradigm, the anatomical correlates of spatial location encoding and retrieval in the healthy human brain as reflected by BOLD fMRI were investigated. During encoding, subjects were instructed to view and keep in mind different locations of an object on a platform seen from different viewpoints in virtual 3D. In retrieval trials, subjects had to recognize previously learned object locations. Comparing activation patterns associated with encoding and recognition on a voxel-by-voxel basis, we found regions in the precuneus bilaterally activated by both processes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compared human brain activation patterns associated with allocentric encoding and retrieval of spatial locations in virtual 3D. Our results provide further information concerning the role of the precuneus in declarative memory processes, pointing to precuneus involvement in encoding and retrieval of spatial locations.

Abstract: Selective attention may be focused upon a region of interest within the visual surroundings, thereby improving the perceptual quality of stimuli at that location. It has been debated whether this spatially selective mechanism plays a role in the attentive selection of whole objects in a visual scene. The relationship between spatial and object-selective attention was investigated here through recordings of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) supplemented with functional magnetic brain imaging (fMRI). Subjects viewed a display consisting of two bar-shaped objects and directed attention to sequences of stimuli (brief corner offsets) at one end of one of the bars. Unattended stimuli belonging to the same object as the attended stimuli elicited spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the visual cortex closely resembling those elicited by the attended stimuli themselves, albeit smaller in amplitude. This enhanced neural activity associated with object-selective attention was localized by use of ERP dipole modeling and fMRI to the lateral occipital extrastriate cortex. We conclude that object-selective attention shares a common neural mechanism with spatial attention that entails the facilitation of sensory processing of stimuli within the boundaries of an attended object.

Abstract: Four-dot masking is a new form of visual masking that does not involve local contour interactions or spatial superimposition of the target stimulus and the mask (as, e.g., in pattern or metacontrast masking). Rather, the effective masking mechanism is based on object substitution. Object substitution masking occurs when low-level visual information representations are altered before target identification through iterative interaction with high-level visual processing stages has been completed. Interestingly, object substitution interacts with attention processes: Strong masking effects are observed when attentional orientation toward the target location is delayed. In contrast, no masking occurs when attention can be rapidly shifted to and engaged onto the target location. We investigated the neural basis of object substitution masking by studying the interaction of spatial attention and masking processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral data indicated a two-way interaction between the factors Spatial Attention (valid vs. invalid cueing) and Masking (four-dot vs. pattern masking). As expected, spatial attention improved performance more strongly during object substitution masking. Functional correlates of this interaction were found in the primary visual cortex, higher visual areas, and left intraparietal sulcus. A region-of-interest analysis in these areas revealed that the largest blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes occurred during effective four-dot masking. In contrast, the weakest signal changes in these areas were observed when target visibility was highest. The data suggest that these areas represent an object substitution network dedicated to the generation and testing of a perceptual hypotheses as described by the object substitution theory of masking of Di-Lollo et al. [Competition for consciousness among visual events: The psychophysics of reentrant visual processes. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 129, 481-507, 2000].

Abstract: Viewing static photographs of objects in motion evokes higher fMRI activation in the human medial temporal complex (MT+) than looking at similar photographs without this implied motion. As MT+ is traditionally thought to be involved in motion perception (and not in form perception), this finding suggests feedback from object-recognition areas onto MT+. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded extracranial potentials evoked by the sight of photographs of biological agents with and without implied motion. The difference in potential between responses to pictures with and without implied motion was maximal between 260 and 400 msec after stimulus onset. Source analysis of this difference revealed one bilateral, symmetrical dipole pair in the occipital lobe. This area also showed a response to real motion, but approximately 100 msec earlier than the implied motion response. The longer latency of the implied motion response in comparison to the real motion response is consistent with a feedback projection onto MT+ following object recognition in higher-level temporal areas.

Abstract: Two objects that project the same visual angle on the retina can appear to occupy very different proportions of the visual field if they are perceived to be at different distances. What happens to the retinotopic map in primary visual cortex (V1) during the perception of these size illusions? Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), that the retinotopic representation of an object changes in accordance with its perceived angular size. A distant object that appears to occupy a larger portion of the visual field activates a larger area in V1 than an object of equal angular size that is perceived to be closer and smaller. These results demonstrate that the retinal size of an object and the depth information in a scene are combined early in the human visual system.

Abstract: The ability to identify conspecifics from the face is of primary interest for human social behavior. Newborns' visual preference for schematic face-like stimuli has been recently related to a sensitivity for visual patterns with a greater number of elements in the upper compared to the lower part. At the adult level, neuroimaging studies have identified a network of cortical areas devoted to the detection and identification of faces. However, whether and how low-level structural properties of face stimuli contribute to the preferential response to faces in these areas remain to be clarified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here we investigated whether the adults' face-sensitive cortical areas show a preference for top-heavy patterns, similarly to newborns' preference. Twelve participants were presented with head-shaped and square patterns with either more elements in the upper or the lower vertical part. In the right fusiform gyrus ('fusiform face area', FFA), an area showing a preference for faces over other visual object categories, there was a larger activation for curvilinear patterns with more high-contrast elements in the upper part, even though these patterns were not perceived as face stimuli. These findings provide direct evidence that the FFA is tuned for geometrical properties fitting best with the structure of faces, a computational mechanism that might drive the automatic detection of faces in the visual world.

Abstract: We used event-related fMRI to test whether recognition memory depends on visual similarity between familiar prototypes and novel exemplars. Subjects memorized portraits, landscapes, and abstract compositions by six painters with a unique style, and later performed a memory recognition task. The prototypes were presented with new exemplars that were either visually similar or dissimilar. Behaviorally, novel, dissimilar items were detected faster and more accurately. We found activation in a distributed cortical network that included face- and object-selective regions in the visual cortex, where familiar prototypes evoked stronger responses than new exemplars; attention-related regions in parietal cortex, where responses elicited by new exemplars were reduced with decreased similarity to the prototypes; and the hippocampus and memory-related regions in parietal and prefrontal cortices, where stronger responses were evoked by the dissimilar exemplars. Our findings suggest that recognition memory is mediated by classification of novel exemplars as a match or a mismatch, based on their visual similarity to familiar prototypes.

Abstract: Working memory is an important cognitive process dependent on a network of prefrontal and posterior cortical regions. In this study we tested the effects of the mixed D1-D2 dopamine receptor agonist pergolide on component processes of human working memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An event-related trial design allowed separation of the effects on encoding, maintenance, and retrieval processes. Subjects were tested with spatial and object memoranda to investigate modality-specific effects of dopaminergic stimulation. We also measured baseline working memory capacity as previous studies have shown that effects of dopamine agonists vary with working memory span. Pergolide improved reaction time for high-span subjects and impaired reaction time for low-span subjects. This span-dependent change in behavior was accompanied by span-dependent changes in delay-related activity in the premotor cortex. We also found evidence for modality-specific effects of pergolide only during the response period. Pergolide increased activity for spatial memoranda and decreased activity for object memoranda in task-related regions including the prefrontal and parietal cortices.

Abstract: Little is known about the neural substrates that underlie difficult haptic discrimination of 3-D within-class object stimuli. Recent work [A.R. Kilgour, R. Kitada, P. Servos, T.W. James, S.J. Lederman, Haptic face identification activates ventral occipital and temporal areas: an fMRI study, Brain Cogn. (in press)] suggests that the left fusiform gyrus may contribute to the identification of facemasks that are haptically explored in the absence of vision. Here, we extend this line of research to investigate the influence of familiarity. Subjects were trained extensively to individuate a set of facemasks in the absence of vision using only haptic exploration. Brain activation was then measured using fMRI while subjects performed a haptic face recognition task on familiar and unfamiliar facemasks. A group analysis contrasting familiar and unfamiliar facemasks found that the left fusiform gyrus produced greater activation with familiar facemasks.

Abstract: Cortical analysis related to visual object recognition is traditionally thought to propagate serially along a bottom-up hierarchy of ventral areas. Recent proposals gradually promote the role of top-down processing in recognition, but how such facilitation is triggered remains a puzzle. We tested a specific model, proposing that low spatial frequencies facilitate visual object recognition by initiating top-down processes projected from orbitofrontal to visual cortex. The present study combined magnetoencephalography, which has superior temporal resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and a behavioral task that yields successful recognition with stimulus repetitions. Object recognition elicited differential activity that developed in the left orbitofrontal cortex 50 ms earlier than it did in recognition-related areas in the temporal cortex. This early orbitofrontal activity was directly modulated by the presence of low spatial frequencies in the image. Taken together, the dynamics we revealed provide strong support for the proposal of how top-down facilitation of object recognition is initiated, and our observations are used to derive predictions for future research.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate quantification of the shape and extent of breast tumors has a vital role in nearly all applications of breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI). Specifically, tumor segmentation is a key component in the computerized assessment of likelihood of malignancy. However, manual delineation of lesions in four-dimensional MR images is labor intensive and subject to interobserver and intraobserver variations. We developed a computerized lesion segmentation method that has the advantage of being automatic, efficient, and objective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering-based method for the segmentation of breast lesions in three dimensions from contrast-enhanced MR images. The proposed lesion segmentation algorithm consists of six consecutive stages: region of interest (ROI) selection by a human operator, lesion enhancement within the selected ROI, application of FCM on the enhanced ROI, binarization of the lesion membership map, connected-component labeling and object selection, and hole-filling on the selected object. We applied the algorithm to a clinical MR database consisting of 121 primary mass lesions. Manual segmentation of the lesions by an expert MR radiologist served as a reference in the evaluation of the computerized segmentation method. We also compared the proposed algorithm with a previously developed volume-growing (VG) method. RESULTS: For the 121 mass lesions in our database, 97% of lesions were segmented correctly by means of the proposed FCM-based method at an overlap threshold of 0.4, whereas 84% of lesions were correctly segmented by means of the VG method. CONCLUSION: Our proposed algorithm for breast-lesion segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was shown to be effective and efficient.

Abstract: Two of the most robust markers for "special" face processing are the behavioral face-inversion effect (FIE)-the disproportionate drop in recognition of upside-down (inverted) stimuli relative to upright faces-and the face-selective fMRI response in the fusiform face area (FFA). However, the relationship between these two face-selective markers is unknown. Here we report that the behavioral FIE is closely associated with the fMRI response in the FFA, but not in other face-selective or object-selective regions. The FFA and the face-selective region in the superior temporal sulcus (f_STS), but not the occipital face-selective region (OFA), showed a higher response to upright than inverted faces. However, only in the FFA was this fMRI-FIE positively correlated across subjects with the behavioral FIE. Second, the FFA, but not the f_STS, showed greater neural sensitivity to differences between faces when they were upright than inverted, suggesting a possible neural mechanism for the behavioral FIE. Although a similar trend was found in the occipital face area (OFA), it was less robust than the FFA. Taken together, our data suggest that among the face-selective and object-selective regions, the FFA is a primary neural source of the behavioral FIE.

Abstract: Working memory (WM), the active maintenance of currently relevant information, is a flexible system allowing for fast and frequent goal-directed changes of rehearsed information. Successful WM maintenance prevents interference from distracting stimuli while allowing new task-relevant information to update the contents of WM. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that when WM contents were updated, regardless of stimulus type (faces or houses), a frontoparietal network showed transient increases in activation. Some of these regions are highly similar to those identified in studies of shifting attention, supporting the idea that updating WM involves a change in the attentional priority afforded to the current perceptual input. A region within the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, near the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus and precentral sulcus (inferior frontal junction), that has previously been implicated in cognitive control, demonstrated transient increases in activity during updating as well as sustained maintenance activity. A more anterior prefrontal region, middle frontal gyrus, previously implicated in protecting the contents of WM from interfering stimuli during maintenance, demonstrated transient increases in activity during updating. The current study suggests that updating WM results from a combination of increased attention to the visual stimulus and a change in the system's interference protection state.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The neural correlate of object recognition in non-canonical views is uncertain, but there is evidence for involvement of neural pathways, possibly separate from those used for object recognition in canonical views. METHODS: Boxcar functional MRI (fMRI) techniques were used to detect neural activity while eight normal subjects were instructed to identify digital photographs of objects in non-canonical and canonical orientations. RESULTS: The right angular gyrus, the left inferior temporal gyrus, and the right cerebellum showed significant fMRI activity during non-canonical as opposed to canonical viewing. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects recognizing objects in non-canonical orientations engage in a process separate from, or in addition to, the process used in recognizing objects in canonical orientations.

Abstract: We investigated the prevalence and specificity of category-selective regions in human visual cortex. In the broadest survey to date of category selectivity in visual cortex, 12 participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing scenes and 19 different object categories in a blocked-design experiment. As expected, we found selectivity for faces in the fusiform face area (FFA), for scenes in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and for bodies in the extrastriate body area (EBA). In addition, we describe 3 main new findings. First, evidence for the selectivity of the FFA, PPA, and EBA was strengthened by the finding that each area responded significantly more strongly to its preferred category than to the next most effective of the remaining 19 stimulus categories tested. Second, a region in the middle temporal gyrus that has been reported to respond significantly more strongly to tools than to animals did not respond significantly more strongly to tools than to other nontool categories (such as fruits and vegetables), casting doubt on the characterization of this region as tool selective. Finally, we did not find any new regions in the occipitotemporal pathway that were strongly selective for other categories. Taken together, these results demonstrate both the strong selectivity of a small number of regions and the scarcity of such regions in visual cortex.

Abstract: Three classic delay tasks: spatial delayed response, delayed spatial alternation and delayed object-alternation are prototypical experimental paradigms for mapping the functional neuroanatomy of prefrontal cortex in animals. These tasks have been applied in human lesion studies, yet there have been very few studies investigating their functional neuroanatomy in healthy human subjects. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the functional neuroanatomy of these classic paradigms (and a fourth: object delayed response) in a single sample of healthy human participants. Consistent with previous animal, human lesion, and functional neuroimaging studies, activity was observed in prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices across all three delay tasks. Task-specific activations, however, were not entirely consistent with predictions drawn from animal lesion studies. For example, delayed object-alternation activated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region not generally implicated in animal lesion reports. Spatial delayed response, classically associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, did not activate this region; it rather activated posterior premotor cortices involved in response preparation, as did spatial alternation. All three tasks activated the frontopolar cortex, a region not considered crucial in animal research but associated with manipulation of internally generated information in recent human research. While cross-method convergence may be attained for lower level perceptual or motor tasks, the results of this study caution against the assumption that lesion-specific effects in animals generalize to human prefrontal cortex function.

Abstract: Since their debut in 1987, snakes (active contour models) have become a standard image analysis technique with several variants now in common use. We present a framework called "United Snakes", which has two key features. First, it unifies the most popular snake variants, including finite difference, B-spline, and Hermite polynomial snakes in a consistent finite element formulation, thus expanding the range of object modeling capabilities within a uniform snake construction process. Second, it embodies the idea that the heretofore presumed competing technique known as "live wire" or "intelligent scissors" is in fact complementary to snakes and that the two techniques can advantageously be combined by introducing an effective hard constraint mechanism. The United Snakes framework amplifies the efficiency and reproducibility of the component techniques, and it offers more flexible interactive control while further minimizing user interactions. We apply United Snakes to several different medical image analysis tasks, including the segmentation of neuronal dendrites in EM images, dynamic chest image analysis, the quantification of growth plates in MR images and the isolation of the breast region in mammograms, demonstrating the generality, accuracy and robustness of the tool.

Abstract: Face recognition is more strongly impaired by stimulus inversion than nonface object recognition. This phenomenon, known as the face inversion effect (FIE), suggests that the visual system contains specialized processing mechanisms that are more engaged by upright faces than by inverted faces or nonface objects. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies indicate that environmental scenes may also recruit specialized-purpose processing machinery but a comparable inversion effect for scenes has not been established. Here we demonstrate that both face and scene inversion lead to behavioral penalties during performance of a continuous visual matching task; however, the scene inversion effect was less robust and declined in magnitude over the course of the experiment. Scene inversion led to greater neural response in the functionally defined lateral occipital (LO) object area for inverted versus upright scenes and reduced response in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), while face inversion lead to greater response in LO and the right middle fusiform (MF) object area for inverted versus upright faces but no change in the fusiform face area (FFA). A whole-brain analysis revealed several regions that responded more strongly to either upright versus inverted faces or upright versus inverted scenes, some of which may be involved in post-recognition processing. These results demonstrate that both face and scene inversion cause a shift from specialized processing streams towards generic object-processing mechanisms; however, this shift only leads to a reliable behavioral penalty in the case of face inversion.

Abstract: Spatial working memory entails the ability to keep spatial information active in working memory over a short period of time. To study the areas of the brain that are involved in spatial working memory, a group of stroke patients was tested with a spatial search task. Patients and healthy controls were asked to search through a number of boxes shown at different locations on a touch-sensitive computer screen in order to find a target object. In subsequent trials, new target objects were hidden in boxes that were previously empty. Within-search errors were made if a participant returned to an already searched box; between-search errors occurred if a participant returned to a box that was already known to contain a target item. The use of a strategy to remember the locations of the target objects was calculated as well. Damage to the right posterior parietal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired the ability to keep spatial information 'on-line', as was indicated by performance on the Corsi Block-Tapping task and the within-search errors. Moreover, patients with damage to the right posterior parietal cortex, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal formation bilaterally made more between-search errors, indicating the importance of these areas in maintaining spatial information in working memory over an extended time period.

Abstract: The present study compared the behavioral effects of sudden motion onsets or color changes (i.e., featural changes) with the effects of new objects (i.e., multiple changes). Experiments 1 and 2 showed that lesions of the pulvinar affect stimulus-driven attentional control only when it is triggered by featural changes, but not by new objects. Experiment 3 revealed that when appended on a new object, a featural change is processed as a part of a more massive new object: Its attentional effects are larger and remain undisturbed by lesions of the pulvinar. In Experiment 4 a temporal superiority effect was found for featural changes, but not for new objects in healthy subjects. These results suggest that featural changes and new objects may be processed through different pathways and that the pulvinar may be particularly involved in stimulus-driven attentional control by sudden events entailing featural changes.

Abstract: The ventral visual stream processes information about the identity of objects ('what'), whereas the dorsal stream processes the spatial locations of objects ('where'). There is a corresponding, although disputed, distinction for the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal areas. Furthermore, there seems to be a distinction between the anterior and posterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in the processing of novel items and new spatial arrangements, respectively. Functional differentiation of the intermediary mid-line cortical and temporal neocortical structures that communicate with the occipitotemporal, occipitoparietal, prefrontal, and MTL structures, however, is unclear. Therefore, in the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined whether the distinction among the MTL structures extends to these closely connected cortical areas. The most striking difference in the fMRI responses during visual presentation of changes in either items or their locations was the bilateral activation of the temporal lobe and ventrolateral prefrontal cortical areas for novel object identification in contrast to wide parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal activation for the novel locations of objects. An anterior-posterior distinction of fMRI responses similar to the MTL was observed in the cingulate/retrosplenial, and superior and middle temporal cortices. In addition to the distinct areas of activation, certain frontal, parietal, and temporo-occipital areas responded to both object and spatial novelty, suggesting a common attentional network for both types of changes in the visual environment. These findings offer new insights to the functional roles and intrinsic specialization of the cingulate/retrosplenial, and lateral temporal cortical areas in visuospatial cognition.

Abstract: Methods utilizing Pade approximants are investigated for implementation with magnetic resonance imaging data and are presented both for direct image reconstruction and for feature extraction. Pade approximants are a numerical tool that can be used to accelerate the convergence of a slowly converging sequence by estimating the fully converged sequence values from early data points. Pade approximants can be calculated directly from k-space data by solving a set of linear matrix equations to produce signal values for any desired location in the image domain. This gives an estimate of the fully converged signal intensity at each pixel location in the image, raising the possibility of reconstructing a better estimate of the object from a reduced data set. These methods have been tested on phantom and human data both for image reconstruction and for feature extraction. In image reconstruction, considerable convergence acceleration can be achieved, with steep intensity boundaries reproduced in keeping with higher resolution reconstructions and oscillatory truncation artifact characteristic of Fourier reconstruction removed. The convergence acceleration is variable and there is the possibility of fine detail suppression when insufficient data are included. The use of Pade methods as a tool for feature extraction has shown good agreement with extraction from high-resolution reference data. In this approach the edge information comes intrinsically from Pade reconstruction.

Abstract: We report detailed analysis of language performance in a patient, RMI, a 55-year-old man who presented with a homonymous hemianopsia, optic aphasia, and alexia without agraphia (with letter-by-letter reading) acutely after stroke. MRI showed infarct in the left occipital and medial temporal lobe and hypoperfusion of the entire posterior cerebral artery territory, including the splenium. Extensive language testing revealed severely impaired picture naming and oral reading, with relatively spared tactile naming and recognition of orally spelled words, consistent with impaired access to lexical and semantic representations from vision. In addition, he had a milder deficit in accessing lexical representations for output from all input modalities. RMI's execution of various language tasks provided considerable insight into the mechanisms that underlie oral reading. His performance indicated that both semantic access and orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms were partially intact. When information from these two impoverished systems was coupled (the picture of an object presented with its written name), his ability to read/name improved significantly, consistent with the hypothesis that partially accessed semantic information from vision can combine with partially accessed sublexical orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms to access phonological representations for output. Furthermore, his written word and picture recognition improved to normal at a time when magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated reperfusion of the splenium. We interpret these results, as well as results from previous studies in the literature, within a model of the neural regions critical for various cognitive processes underlying reading.

Abstract: Visual object perception has been suggested to follow two different routes in the human brain: a ventral, view-invariant occipital-temporal route processes object identity, whereas a dorsal, view-dependent occipital-parietal route processes spatial properties of an object. Using fMRI, we addressed the question whether these routes are exclusively involved in either object recognition or spatial representation. We presented subjects with images of natural objects and involved them either in object identification or object orientation judgment task. For both tasks, we observed activation in ventro-temporal as well as parietal areas bilaterally, with significantly stronger responses for the orientation judgment in both ventro-temporal as well as parietal areas. Our findings suggest that object identification and orientation judgment do not follow strictly separable cortical pathways, but rather involve both the dorsal and the ventral stream.

Abstract: The formation of cortical object representations requires the activation of cell assemblies, correlated by induced oscillatory bursts above 20 Hz (gamma band), which are characterized by trial-by-trial latency fluctuations around a mean of approximately 300 ms after stimulus onset. The present electroencephalogram (EEG) study was intended to uncover to the generators of induced gamma band responses (GBRs) and to analyze phase-synchronization between these sources. A standard object recognition task was used to elicit gamma activity. At the scalp surface (electrode space), we found an augmentation of induced GBRs after the presentation of meaningful (familiar) as opposed to meaningless (unfamiliar) stimuli, which was accompanied by a dense pattern of significant phase-locking values between distant recording sites. Subsequently, intracranial current density distributions compatible with the observed scalp voltage topographies were estimated by means of VARETA (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography). In source space brain electrical tomographies (BETs) revealed widespread generators of induced GBRs at temporal, parietal, posterior, and frontal areas. Phase-locking analysis was calculated between re-constructed electrode signals based on separate forward solutions of the observed generators, thereby eliminating the possibly confounding influence of activity from areas not under observation. The results support the view that induced GBRs signify synchronous neuronal activity in a broadly distributed network during object recognition. The localization of the generators of event-related potentials (ERPs), evoked gamma activity, and induced alpha activity revealed different sources as compared to the induced GBR and, thus, seem to mirror complementary functions during the present task as compared to induced high-frequency brain dynamics.

Abstract: Object-selective cortical regions exhibit a decreased response when an object stimulus is repeated [repetition suppression (RS)]. RS is often associated with priming: reduced response times and increased accuracy for repeated stimuli. It is unknown whether RS reflects stimulus-specific repetition, the associated changes in response time, or the combination of the two. To address this question, we performed a rapid event-related functional MRI (fMRI) study in which we measured BOLD signal in object-selective cortex, as well as object recognition performance, while we manipulated stimulus repetition. Our design allowed us to examine separately the roles of response time and repetition in explaining RS. We found that repetition played a robust role in explaining RS: repeated trials produced weaker BOLD responses than nonrepeated trials, even when comparing trials with matched response times. In contrast, response time played a weak role in explaining RS when repetition was controlled for: it explained BOLD responses only for one region of interest (ROI) and one experimental condition. Thus repetition suppression seems to be mostly driven by repetition rather than performance changes. We further examined whether RS reflects processes occurring at the same time as recognition or after recognition by manipulating stimulus presentation duration. In one experiment, durations were longer than required for recognition (2 s), whereas in a second experiment, durations were close to the minimum time required for recognition (85-101 ms). We found significant RS for brief presentations (albeit with a reduced magnitude), which again persisted when controlling for performance. This suggests a substantial amount of RS occurs during recognition.

Abstract: With practice, we become increasingly efficient at visual object comparisons. This may be due to the formation of a memory template that not only binds individual features together to create an object, but also links the object with an associated response. In a longitudinal fMRI study of object matching, evidence for this link between perception and action was observed as a shift of activation from visual-attentive processing areas along the posterior intraparietal sulcus to hand-sensory and motor-related areas.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The neural basis of formal thought disorder (FTD) is unknown. An influential theory is that FTD results from impaired semantic memory processing. We explored the neural correlates of semantic memory retrieval in schizophrenia using an imaging task assessing semantic object recall. METHOD: Sixteen healthy control subjects and sixteen schizophrenia patients whose FTD symptoms were measured with the Thought Disorder Index completed a verbal object-recall task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants viewed two words describing object features that either evoked (object recall) or did not evoke a semantic concept. RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients tended to overrecall objects for feature pairs that did not describe the same object. Functionally, rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation in patients positively correlated with FTD severity during both correct recalled and overrecalled trials. Compared with control subjects, during object recalling, patients overactivated bilateral ACC, temporooccipital junctions, temporal poles and parahippocampi, right inferior frontal gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but underactivated inferior parietal lobules. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support impaired semantic memory retrieval as underlying FTD pathophysiology. Schizophrenia patients showed abnormal activations of brain areas involved in semantic memory, verbal working memory, and initiation and suppression of conflicting responses, which were associated with semantic overrecall and FTD.

Abstract: The learning process related to pattern and object recognition is difficult to study because the human brain has a remarkable capacity to recognise complex visual forms from early infancy. In the present study, we investigated on-going neural changes underlying the learning process of visual pattern recognition by means of a device substituting audition for vision. Functional MRI evidenced the gradual pattern recognition-induced recruitment of the ventral visual stream, bilaterally, from learning session 1 to session 3, and a slight decrease in these activation foci from session 3 to session 4. The initial increase in activation is thought to reflect the gradually enhanced visualisation of patterns in the subjects' mind across sessions. By contrast the subsequent decrease reported at the end of the training period is interpreted as the progressive optimisation of neuronal responses elicited by the task. Our results, in accordance with previous observations, suggest that the succession of activation increase and decrease in sensori-motor areas could be a general rule in sensory and sensori-motor learning.

Abstract: A robust finding among functional neuroimaging studies on visual priming is decreased neural activity in extrastriate and inferior prefrontal cortices for the second presentation of an object relative to its first presentation. This effect can also be observed for different but perceptually similar objects that are alternative exemplars of the initially presented object (e.g. two different pencils). An unanswered question is whether this decrease in activity can be found for the successive presentation of similar complex visual scenes. We used a test in which landscape pictures were divided vertically into three segments. A first segment was presented and followed several stimuli later by a second related segment. Reaction times were faster for the presentation of the second segment relative to the first one. Although perceptually different from the first segment, the presentation of the second segment was nonetheless associated with reduced activity in late stage visual processing areas including parahippocampal/fusiform gyri bilaterally, left middle occipital and temporal gyri, right inferior temporal and superior occipital gyri, and in left inferior frontal gyrus. The observed decreases in activity in these regions replicate results on priming of different exemplars of single objects while further extending these results to similar complex visual scenes. The presentation of the second segment was also associated with increased activity mainly in frontal and parietal regions, two areas known to be associated with memory retrieval. In sum, priming effects can also occur for complex visual scenes that are intrinsically different from each other although similar in their composition.

Abstract: Humans are capable of recognizing objects, often despite highly adverse viewing conditions (e.g., occlusion). The term "perceptual closure" has been used to refer to the neural processes responsible for "filling-in" missing information in the visual image under such conditions. Closure phenomena have been linked to a group of object recognition areas, the so-called lateral-occipital complex (LOC). Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of perceptual closure processes by coregistering data from high-density electrical recordings (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects participated in a perceptual closure task. Subjects were presented with highly fragmented images and control scrambled images. Fragmented images were calibrated to be 'just' recognizable as objects (that is, perceptual closure was necessary), whereas the scrambled images were unrecognizable. Comparison of responses to these two stimulus classes revealed the neural processes underlying perceptual closure. fMRI revealed an object recognition system that mediates these closure processes, the core of which consists of the LOC regions. ERP recordings resulted in the well-characterized N(CL) component (for negativity associated with closure), a robust relative negativity over bilateral occipito-temporal scalp that occurs in the 230-400 ms timeframe. Our investigations further revealed an extended network of dorsal and frontal regions, also involved in perceptual closure processes. Inverse source analysis showed that the major generators of N(CL) localized to the identical regions within LOC revealed by the fMRI recordings and detailed the temporal dynamics across these LOC regions including interactions between LOC and these other nodes of the object recognition circuit.

Abstract: A technique is proposed for correcting both translational and rotational motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging without the need to collect additional navigator data or to perform intensive postprocessing. The method is based on measuring the point spread function (PSF) by attaching one or two point-sized markers to the main imaging object. Following the isolation of a PSF marker from the acquired image, translational motion could be corrected directly from the modulation transfer function, without the need to determine the object's positions during the scan, although the shifts could be extracted if desired. Rotation is detected by analyzing the relative displacements of two such markers. The technique was evaluated with simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The study aimed to identify brain activation during direct and automatic processing of phobogenic stimuli in specific phobia. METHODS: Responses to phobia-related and neutral pictures (spiders and mushrooms) were measured by means of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging during two different tasks. In the identification task, subjects were asked to identify the object (spider or mushroom). In a demanding distraction task, subjects had to match geometric figures displayed in the foreground of the pictures. RESULTS: Phobics showed greater responses to spiders versus mushrooms in the left amygdala, left insula, left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) during the identification task and in the left and right amygdala during the distraction task. All of these activations were also significantly increased compared to control subjects who did not show stronger brain activation to spiders versus mushrooms under any task condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings propose specific neural correlates of automatic versus direct evaluation of phobia-relevant threat. While the amygdala, especially the right amygdala, seems to be crucially involved in automatic stimuli processing, activation of areas such as the insula, ACC and DMPFC is rather associated with direct threat evaluation and requires sufficient attentional resources.

Abstract: This paper uses whole brain functional neuroimaging in neurologically normal participants to explore how reading aloud differs from object naming in terms of neuronal implementation. In the first experiment, we directly compared brain activation during reading aloud and object naming. This revealed greater activation for reading in bilateral premotor, left posterior superior temporal and precuneus regions. In a second experiment, we segregated the object-naming system into object recognition and speech production areas by factorially manipulating the presence or absence of objects (pictures of objects or their meaningless scrambled counterparts) with the presence or absence of speech production (vocal vs. finger press responses). This demonstrated that the areas associated with speech production (object naming and repetitively saying "OK" to meaningless scrambled pictures) corresponded exactly to the areas where responses were higher for reading aloud than object naming in Experiment 1. Collectively the results suggest that, relative to object naming, reading increases the demands on shared speech production processes. At a cognitive level, enhanced activation for reading in speech production areas may reflect the multiple and competing phonological codes that are generated from the sublexical parts of written words. At a neuronal level, it may reflect differences in the speed with which different areas are activated and integrate with one another.

Abstract: We tested functional activation for faces in patient D.F., who following acquired brain damage has a profound deficit in object recognition based on form (visual form agnosia) and also prosopagnosia that is undocumented to date. Functional imaging demonstrated that like our control observers, D.F. shows significantly more activation when passively viewing face compared to scene images in an area that is consistent with the fusiform face area (FFA) (p < 0.01). Control observers also show occipital face area (OFA) activation; however, whereas D.F.'s lesions appear to overlap the OFA bilaterally. We asked, given that D.F. shows FFA activation for faces, to what extent is she able to recognize faces? D.F. demonstrated a severe impairment in higher level face processing--she could not recognize face identity, gender or emotional expression. In contrast, she performed relatively normally on many face categorization tasks. D.F. can differentiate faces from non-faces given sufficient texture information and processing time, and she can do this is independent of color and illumination information. D.F. can use configural information for categorizing faces when they are presented in an upright but not a sideways orientation and given that she also cannot discriminate half-faces she may rely on a spatially symmetric feature arrangement. Faces appear to be a unique category, which she can classify even when she has no advance knowledge that she will be shown face images. Together, these imaging and behavioral data support the importance of the integrity of a complex network of regions for face identification, including more than just the FFA--in particular the OFA, a region believed to be associated with low-level processing.

Abstract: The existence of facial aftereffects suggests that shape-selective mechanisms at the higher stages of visual object coding -- similarly to the early processing of low-level visual features -- are adaptively recalibrated. Our goal was to uncover the ERP correlates of shape-selective adaptation and to test whether it is also involved in the visual processing of human body parts. We found that prolonged adaptation to female hands -- similarly to adaptation to female faces -- biased the judgements about the subsequently presented hand test stimuli: they were perceived more masculine than in the control conditions. We also showed that these hand aftereffects are size and orientation invariant. However, no aftereffects were found when the adaptor and test stimuli belonged to different categories (i.e. face adaptor and hand test, or vice versa), suggesting that the underlying adaptation mechanisms are category-specific. In accordance with the behavioral results, both adaptation to faces and hands resulted in a strong and category-specific modulation -- reduced amplitude and increased latency -- of the N170 component of ERP responses. Our findings suggest that shape-selective adaptation is a general mechanism of visual object processing and its neural effects are primarily reflected in the N170 component of the ERP responses.

Abstract: Unlike tasks in which practice leads to an automatic stimulus-response association, it is thought working memory (WM) tasks continue to require cognitive control processes after repeated performance. Previous studies investigating WM task repetition are in accord with this. However, it is unclear whether changes in neural activity after repetition imply alterations in general control processes common to all WM tasks or are specific to the selection, encoding and maintenance of the relevant information. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine changes during sample, delay and test periods during repetition of both object and spatial delayed recognition tasks. We found decreases in fMRI activation in both spatial and object-selective areas after spatial WM task repetition, independent of behavioral performance. Few areas showed changed activity after object WM task repetition. These results indicate that spatial task repetition leads to increased efficiency of maintaining task-relevant information and improved ability to filter out task-irrelevant information. The specificity of this repetition effect to the spatial task suggests a difference exists in the nature of the representation of object and spatial information and that their maintenance in WM is likely subserved by different neural systems.

Abstract: Neuropsychological case studies suggest the existence of two functionally separate visual streams: the ventral pathway, central for object recognition; and the dorsal pathway, engaged in visually guided actions. However, a clear dissociation between the functions of the two streams has not been decisively shown in intact humans. In this study, we demonstrate dissociation between dorsal and ventral fMRI activation patterns during observation of object manipulation video clips. Parietal areas, such as anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) display grasp viewing-dependent adaptation (i.e., fMR adaptation during repeated viewing of the same object-grasping movement) as well as a contralateral preference for the viewed manipulating hand. Ventral regions, such as the fusiform gyrus, show similar characteristics (i.e., adaptation, contralateral preference), but these depend on object identity. Our results support the hypothesized functional specialization in the visual system and suggest that parietal areas (such as aIPS) are engaged in action recognition, as well as in action planning.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with prosopagnosia from occipitotemporal lesions have impaired perception of the configuration of facial features. This may be an example of impaired "within-object" spatial coding, which others propose to be distinct from "between-object" spatial coding. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the prosopagnosic deficit in perceiving spatial configuration was specific to within-face and not between-face spatial coding and whether the deficit was face-selective or extended to objects other than faces. METHODS: Six prosopagnosic patients were tested using an oddity paradigm in which they detected which of three simultaneously seen stimuli was an altered target. In the "within-face" task, the target face had altered interocular distance or mouth position. In the "between-face" task, the target face was located farther away from the other two. In the "within-object" task, the stimulus was a two-dot pattern, and the target pattern had altered interdot distance. RESULTS: Spatial judgments were impaired within faces for all six patients and within the two-dot pattern for five of six patients. However, all six had normal between-face spatial perception. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired perception of spatial relations in prosopagnosia is selective to the spatial structure within individual objects and spares the perception of spatial location of objects. It is not specific to faces. It reveals a process involved in analyzing object structure, consistent with the patients' deficits in recognizing facial identity, and illustrates a different type of "visuospatial" defect.

Abstract: The perception of objects is a cognitive function of prime importance. In everyday life, object perception benefits from the coordinated interplay of vision, audition, and touch. The different sensory modalities provide both complementary and redundant information about objects, which may improve recognition speed and accuracy in many circumstances. We review crossmodal studies of object recognition in humans that mainly employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These studies show that visual, tactile, and auditory information about objects can activate cortical association areas that were once believed to be modality-specific. Processing converges either in multisensory zones or via direct crossmodal interaction of modality-specific cortices without relay through multisensory regions. We integrate these findings with existing theories about semantic processing and propose a general mechanism for crossmodal object recognition: The recruitment and location of multisensory convergence zones varies depending on the information content and the dominant modality.

Abstract: Individuals with normal vision can sometimes momentarily mistake one object for another. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated how extrastriate visual regions respond during these erroneous perceptual judgements. Subjects were asked to discriminate images of houses and faces that were degraded such that they were close to an individually defined threshold for perception. On correct trials, voxels localized on the inferior occipital (OFA), fusiform (FFA) and parahippocampal (PPA) gyri exhibited selectivity for face and house images as expected. On incorrect trials, no face- or place-selectivity was observed for OFA or PPA. However, consistent with 'predictive coding' accounts of perception, we observed that the FFA also responded robustly on trials where a house was misperceived as a face, and concurrent activation was observed in medio-frontal and right parietal regions previously implicated in decision making under uncertainty. We suggest that FFA responses during misperception may be driven by a predictive top-down signal from these regions.

Abstract: There has been considerable debate as to whether the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex may subserve both memory and perception. We administered a series of oddity tasks, in which subjects selected the odd stimulus from a visual array, to amnesic patients with either selective hippocampal damage (HC group) or more extensive medial temporal damage, including the perirhinal cortex (MTL group). All patients performed normally when the stimuli could be discriminated using simple visual features, even if faces or complex virtual reality scenes were presented. Both patient groups were, however, severely impaired at scene discrimination when a significant demand was placed on processing spatial information across viewpoint independent representations, while only the MTL group showed a significant deficit in oddity judgments of faces and objects when object viewpoint independent perception was emphasized. These observations provide compelling evidence that the human hippocampus and perirhinal cortex are critical to processes beyond long-term declarative memory and may subserve spatial and object perception, respectively.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Dopamine is abundant in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, regions implicated in working memory processes. Monkey studies suggest that subpopulations of prefrontal neurons are sensitive to component processes of working memory, and that dopaminergic actions at D1 and D2 receptors differentially affect these neurons. However, it is not known to what extent the effects of dopaminergic stimulation may differ in human subjects across the processing stages of working memory, and whether these effects are found throughout the network of task-related brain regions. OBJECTIVE: In this study we tested the effects of the D2 dopamine agonist bromocriptine during the performance of a delayed recognition task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: We measured blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals as subjects performed a spatial and object delayed recognition task. Subjects were scanned twice, once following 1.25 mg of bromocriptine and once following lactose placebo in a randomized double-blind design. Using an event-related design allowed for separate investigation of encoding, delay, and response period effects of dopaminergic stimulation. RESULTS: A group analysis revealed that bromocriptine treatment decreased activity in the task network at encoding and increased activity at response. There was no clear pattern of change in the delay period network. Across subjects, these BOLD signal changes were accompanied by reductions in accuracy and increases in response time during delayed recognition for spatial and object information. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased activity during encoding suggests that hyperdopaminergic stimulation may have reduced stimulus encoding processes, contributing to impaired performance.

Abstract: We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that examined novelty responses in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) to determine whether the hippocampus makes contributions to memory processing that differ from those of structures in the adjacent parahippocampal region. In light of proposals that such differential contributions may pertain to relational processing demands, we assessed event-related fMRI responses in the MTL for novel single objects and for novel spatial and non-spatial object relationships; subjects were asked to detect these different types of novelties among previously studied items, and they successfully performed this task during scanning. A double dissociation that emerged from the response pattern of regions in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex provided the strongest support for functional specialization in the MTL. A region in the right middle hippocampus responded to the novelty of spatial and non-spatial relationships but not to the novelty of individual objects. By contrast, a region in right perirhinal cortex, situated in the anterior collateral sulcus, responded to the novelty of individual objects but not to that of either type of relationship. Other MTL regions that responded to novelty in the present study showed no reliable difference in their response to the various novelty types; these regions included anterior parts of the hippocampus and posterior aspects of parahippocampal cortex. Together, our findings indicate that relational processing demands are a critical determinant of functional specialization in the human MTL. They also suggest, however, that a neuroanatomical framework that only distinguishes between the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region is not sufficiently refined to account for all functional differences and similarities observed with respect to relational processes in the human MTL.

Abstract: A considerable recent literature argues that the same representations, encoded by inferior prefrontal and parietal cells known as "mirror neurons", may be activated in both production and recognition of object-related actions. Here, we test several predictions derived from the contemporary literature on the parity between production and recognition and the putative emergence of the mirror neuron system from a system coding hand-object interactions. Forty-four patients with left-hemisphere stroke, 21 of whom exhibited ideomotor apraxia, performed a number of pantomime imitation and recognition tasks, and performance was scored with respect to hand posture, arm posture, amplitude, and timing. Consistent with predictions, there were strong relationships between object-related pantomime imitation and object-related pantomime recognition, and between imitation and recognition of the hand posture component of object-related actions. Skilled object-related gesture representations are likely to be closely tied to evolutionarily more primitive systems controlling object grasping, to emerge from a mapping between object and action information coded by ventral and dorsal streams, and to be lateralized to the left hemisphere in humans.

Abstract: Language functions in the left basal temporal area (LBTA) were investigated using electrical cortical stimulation during functional mapping in six Japanese patients with refractory epilepsy. This study provides the first direct evidence that kana (Japanese syllabogram) is processed in the LBTA. Electrical stimulation of some areas within LBTA induced disturbance in overt reading of kana words only in the first trials, with no errors in the subsequent trials. By contrast, stimulation of the same area caused obvious disturbance in kana non-word reading in all trials. Since a kana word carries both meaning and sound while a kana non-word carries only sounds of a letter string, the contrasting results of partial and complete disturbance imply a possibility that there are two distinct pathways for kana reading: one dealing with both phonological and semantic aspects of the words and the other dealing only with phonological aspect. Kanji words (Japanese morphogram) and objects/pictures were found to be processed in an area different from the area for the kana non-word processing. Furthermore, the present study also identified the common area for processing kanji reading and object/picture naming. There were no errors in matching pictures with kanji words, indicating that concepts of pictures and meanings of kanji words were not interfered by the electrical stimulation of that area. The new insight provides a clue for partial description of processing pathways for language-related visual information in LBTA. Three types of information (morphological, phonological, and semantic) are conveyed together at some stages and are separated into different routes at some other stages.

Abstract: Inferences drawn from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are dependent on the statistical criteria used to define different brain regions as "active" or "inactive" under the experimental manipulation. In fMRI studies of multisensory integration, additional criteria are used to classify a subset of the active brain regions as "multisensory." Because there is no general agreement in the literature on the optimal criteria for performing this classification, we investigated the effects of seven different multisensory statistical criteria on a single test dataset collected as human subjects performed auditory, visual, and auditory- visual object recognition. Activation maps created using the different criteria differed dramatically. The classification of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) was used as a performance measure, because a large body of converging evidence demonstrates that the STS is important for auditory-visual integration. A commonly proposed criterion, "supra-additivity" or "super-additivity", which requires the multisensory response to be larger than the summed unisensory responses, did not classify STS as multisensory. Alternative criteria, such as requiring the multisensory response to be larger than the maximum or the mean of the unisensory responses, successfully classified STS as multisensory. This practical demonstration strengthens theoretical arguments that the super-additivity is not an appropriate criterion for all studies of multisensory integration. Moreover, the importance of examining evoked fMRI responses, whole brain activation maps, maps from multiple individual subjects, and mixed-effect group maps are discussed in the context of selecting statistical criteria.

Abstract: The 'correspondence problem' refers to the ambiguity of apparent motion (AM) paths if several similar objects are displaced across successive displays. We investigated the effect of intrinsic object properties such as colour and luminance on AM paths, and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize neural correlates of correspondence matching in visual cortical regions. Human subjects looked at an AM display where two dots in diagonally opposite corners of an implicit rectangle were flashed in alternation with two dots in the other two corners, yielding spontaneous alternations between horizontal and vertical AM. The dots differed in colour or luminance, or were identical. Neural activity was analysed as a function of whether the perceived AM path matched the dots' colour or luminance, and was also compared to activity during bistable AM displays without correspondence cues. When AM paths matched colour and luminance cues, activity in early visual cortex was the same as during perception of uncued displays, whereas it was suppressed when perceived AM paths violated colour or luminance cues. Colour-sensitive extrastriate cortex (V4 complex) transiently activated whenever AM perception switched from a pattern violating colour correspondence to one consistent with colour. We propose that the neural correlate of correspondence in early visual cortex reflects regulatory mechanisms that flexibly gate early visual feature processing in accord with an overriding perceptual decision. Conversely, activation of feature-selective extrastriate regions depends on the type of cue used for correspondence matching and may reflect the salience of percepts that match in colour and motion.

Abstract: We used an event-related fMR-adaptation paradigm to investigate changes in BOLD activity in the dorsal and ventral visual streams as a function of object identity and object orientation. Participants viewed successive paired images of real-world, graspable objects, separated by a visual mask. The second image of each pair was either: (i) the same as the first image, (ii) different only in identity, (iii) different only in orientation, or (iv) different in both identity and orientation. A region in the parieto-occipital cortex (dorsal stream) showed a selective increase in BOLD activity with changes in object orientation, but was insensitive to changes in object identity. In contrast, a region in the temporo-occipital cortex (ventral stream) showed a selective increase in activity with changes in identity, but was insensitive to changes in orientation. The differential sensitivity to orientation and identity is consistent with the idea that the dorsal stream plays a critical role in the visual control of object-directed actions while the ventral stream plays a critical role in object perception.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Abnormal temporal connections with other cortical areas may underlie some of the most prominent cognitive deficits described in schizophrenia. In order to evaluate the relationship between temporal and other cortical regions in schizophrenia, we examined the intercorrelations of volumetric measures of gray and white matter for each Brodmann's area of the temporal lobe with volumes in the rest of the cortex in patients with schizophrenia and normal comparison subjects. METHODS: MR images were acquired in normal subjects (n=46) and patients with schizophrenia (n=106), divided into good-outcome (n=52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian; n=54) subtypes; and correlational patterns between the volumes of individual Brodmann's areas were compared and examined in relation to outcome. RESULTS: Positive frontotemporal intercorrelations were significantly stronger while negative frontotemporal intercorrelations were weaker in schizophrenia patients as compared to normal subjects. Correlations between the right temporal pole and other temporal regions were significantly weaker in schizophrenia patients than in controls. When compared to normal controls and good-outcome patients, schizophrenia patients with poor outcomes showed a selective pattern of stronger gray matter correlations between the medial temporal vs. primary visual and between primary auditory vs. dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, all in the left hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening of positive associations among the temporal and extratemporal (mainly frontal and occipital) regions as well as weakening of regional intercorrelations within the temporal lobe in patients appear to constitute the major differences of correlational patterns in schizophrenia patients and normal subjects. Present findings may be implicated in object recognition deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia, as well as in purportedly deficient spatial and semantic processing of both auditory and visual information that may be associated with poor outcome.

Abstract: This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying two types of spatial transformations: imagined object rotations and imagined rotations of the self about an object. Participants viewed depictions of single three-dimensional Shepard--Metzler objects situated within a sphere. A T-shaped prompt appeared outside of the sphere at different locations across trials. In the object rotation task, participants imagined rotating the object so that one of its ends was aligned with the prompt. They then judged whether a textured portion of the object would be visible in its new orientation. In the self rotation task, they imagined rotating themselves to the location of the T-prompt, and then judged whether a textured portion of the object would be visible from the new viewpoint. Activation in both tasks was compared to respective control conditions in which identical judgments were made without rotation. A direct comparison of self and object rotation tasks revealed activation spreading from left premotor to left primary motor (M1) cortex (areas 6/4) for imagined object rotations, but not imagined self rotations. In contrast, the self rotation task activated left supplementary motor area (SMA; area 6). In both transformations, activation also occurred in other regions. These findings provide evidence for multiple spatial-transformation mechanisms within the human cognitive system.

Abstract: Expertise in recognizing objects in cluttered scenes is a critical skill for our interactions in complex environments and is thought to develop with learning. However, the neural implementation of object learning across stages of visual analysis in the human brain remains largely unknown. Using combined psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show a link between shape-specific learning in cluttered scenes and distributed neuronal plasticity in the human visual cortex. We report stronger fMRI responses for trained than untrained shapes across early and higher visual areas when observers learned to detect low-salience shapes in noisy backgrounds. However, training with high-salience pop-out targets resulted in lower fMRI responses for trained than untrained shapes in higher occipitotemporal areas. These findings suggest that learning of camouflaged shapes is mediated by increasing neural sensitivity across visual areas to bolster target segmentation and feature integration. In contrast, learning of prominent pop-out shapes is mediated by associations at higher occipitotemporal areas that support sparser coding of the critical features for target recognition. We propose that the human brain learns novel objects in complex scenes by reorganizing shape processing across visual areas, while taking advantage of natural image correlations that determine the distinctiveness of target shapes.

Abstract: Human listeners can effortlessly categorize a wide range of environmental sounds. Whereas categorizing visual object classes (e.g., faces, tools, houses, etc.) preferentially activates different regions of visually sensitive cortex, it is not known whether the auditory system exhibits a similar organization for different types or categories of complex sounds outside of human speech. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that hearing and correctly or incorrectly categorizing animal vocalizations (as opposed to hand-manipulated tool sounds) preferentially activated middle portions of the left and right superior temporal gyri (mSTG). On average, the vocalization sounds had much greater harmonic and phase-coupling content (acoustically similar to human speech sounds), which may represent some of the signal attributes that preferentially activate the mSTG regions. In contrast, correctly categorized tool sounds (and even animal sounds that were miscategorized as being tool-related sounds) preferentially activated a widespread, predominantly left hemisphere cortical "mirror network." This network directly overlapped substantial portions of motor-related cortices that were independently activated when participants pantomimed tool manipulations with their right (dominant) hand. These data suggest that the recognition processing for some sounds involves a causal reasoning mechanism (a high-level auditory "how" pathway), automatically evoked when attending to hand-manipulated tool sounds, that effectively associates the dynamic motor actions likely to have produced the sound(s).

Abstract: In this fMRI study, we examined the relationship between activations in the inferotemporal region (ventral pathway) and the parietal region (dorsal pathway), as well as in the prefrontal cortex (associated with working memory), in a modified mental rotation task. We manipulated figural complexity (simple vs. complex) to affect the figure recognition process (associated with the ventral pathway) and the amount of rotation (0 degrees vs. 90 degrees), typically associated with the dorsal pathway. The pattern of activation not only showed that both streams are affected by both manipulations, but also showed an overadditive interaction. The effect of figural complexity was greater for 90 degrees rotation than for 0 degrees in multiple regions, including the ventral, dorsal, and prefrontal regions. In addition, functional connectivity analyses on the correlations across the time courses of activation between regions of interest showed increased synchronization among multiple brain areas as task demand increased. The results indicate that both the dorsal and the ventral pathways show interactive effects of object and spatial processing, and they suggest that multiple regions interact to perform mental rotation.

Abstract: Multisensory experiences enhance perceptions and facilitate memory retrieval processes, even when only unisensory information is available for accessing such memories. Using fMRI, we identified human brain regions involved in discriminating visual stimuli according to past multisensory vs. unisensory experiences. Subjects performed a completely orthogonal task, discriminating repeated from initial image presentations intermixed within a continuous recognition task. Half of initial presentations were multisensory, and all repetitions were exclusively visual. Despite only single-trial exposures to initial image presentations, accuracy in indicating image repetitions was significantly improved by past auditory-visual multisensory experiences over images only encountered visually. Similarly, regions within the lateral-occipital complex-areas typically associated with visual object recognition processes-were more active to visual stimuli with multisensory than unisensory pasts. Additional differential responses were observed in the anterior cingulate and frontal cortices. Multisensory experiences are registered by the brain even when of no immediate behavioral relevance and can be used to categorize memories. These data reveal the functional efficacy of multisensory processing.

Abstract: Our perception of the world's three-dimensional (3D) structure is critical for object recognition, navigation and planning actions. To accomplish this, the brain combines different types of visual information about depth structure, but at present, the neural architecture mediating this combination remains largely unknown. Here, we report neuroimaging correlates of human 3D shape perception from the combination of two depth cues. We measured fMRI responses while observers judged the 3D structure of two sequentially presented images of slanted planes defined by binocular disparity and perspective. We compared the behavioral and fMRI responses evoked by changes in one or both of the depth cues. fMRI responses in extrastriate areas (hMT+/V5 and lateral occipital complex), rather than responses in early retinotopic areas, reflected differences in perceived 3D shape, suggesting 'combined-cue' representations in higher visual areas. These findings provide insight into the neural circuits engaged when the human brain combines different information sources for unified 3D visual perception.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake monkeys and humans was used to compare object adaptation in shape-sensitive regions of these two species under identical and different size conditions. Object adaptation was similar in humans and monkeys under both conditions. Neither species showed complete size invariance, in agreement with single-cell studies. Both the macaque inferotemporal (IT) complex and human lateral occipital complex (LOC) displayed an anteroposterior gradient in object adaptation and size invariance, with the more anterior regions being more adaptable and size invariant. The results provide additional evidence for the homology between the macaque IT cortex and human LOC but also add to the growing list of differences between human and monkey intraparietal sulcus regions.

Abstract: Do we identify an object as a whole or by its parts? This simple question has been surprisingly hard to answer. It has been suggested that faces are recognized as wholes and words are recognized by parts. Here we answer the question by applying a test for crowding. In crowding, a target is harder to identify in the presence of nearby flankers. Previous work has described crowding between objects. We show that crowding also occurs between the parts of an object. Such internal crowding severely impairs perception, identification, and fMRI face-area activation. We apply a diagnostic test for crowding to a word and a face, and we find that the critical spacing of the parts required for recognition is proportional to distance from fixation and independent of size and kind. The critical spacing defines an isolation field around the target. Some objects can be recognized only when each part is isolated from the rest of the object by the critical spacing. In that case, recognition is by parts. Recognition is holistic if the observer can recognize the object even when the whole object fits within a critical spacing. Such an object has only one part. Multiple parts within an isolation field will crowd each other and spoil recognition. To assess the robustness of the crowding test, we manipulated familiarity through inversion and the face- and word-superiority effects. We find that threshold contrast for word and face identification is the product of two factors: familiarity and crowding. Familiarity increases sensitivity by a factor of x1.5, independent of eccentricity, while crowding attenuates sensitivity more and more as eccentricity increases. Our findings show that observers process words and faces in much the same way: The effects of familiarity and crowding do not distinguish between them. Words and faces are both recognized by parts, and their parts -- letters and facial features -- are recognized holistically. We propose that internal crowding be taken as the signature of recognition by parts.

Abstract: Object and face representations in ventral temporal (VT) cortex were investigated by combining object confusability data from a computational model of object classification with neural response confusability data from a functional neuroimaging experiment. A pattern-based classification algorithm learned to categorize individual brain maps according to the object category being viewed by the subject. An identical algorithm learned to classify an image-based, view-dependent representation of the stimuli. High correlations were found between the confusability of object categories and the confusability of brain activity maps. This occurred even with the inclusion of multiple views of objects, and when the object classification model was tested with high spatial frequency "line drawings" of the stimuli. Consistent with a distributed representation of objects in VT cortex, the data indicate that object categories with shared image-based attributes have shared neural structure.

Abstract: Dissociation between the ability to recognize misoriented objects and to determine their orientation has been reported in a small number of patients, but the long-term course of this deficit has not been reported so far. Here, we describe the case of a 32-year-old female who had bilateral occipito-temporal damage caused by a cerebrovascular accident. Neuropsychological assessment performed at 6 months after the occurrence of the cerebrovascular accident revealed that she was almost generally agnostic for object orientation. The patient was then re-tested 3 years later, when she showed apparently striking recovery in her ability to determine object orientation. However, closer examination revealed that she still displayed the same impairment, although at this time, it was only for objects presented in non-cardinal angles. Moreover, she had problems mostly discriminating orientations that differed by small amounts. The ability of patients to discriminate a variety of orientations should be further tested in future investigations in this field.

Abstract: The recognition of both personally familiar objects and places involves nonspatial memory retrieval processes, but only personally familiar places are represented as space. Although the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is considered to process both types of such memories, its functional organization is poorly understood. In this event-related fMRI study, normal subjects judged familiar/unfamiliar pictures in four categories: familiar places (FP), familiar objects (FO), unfamiliar places (UP), and unfamiliar objects (UO), thus constituting a two-factorial design. A significant main effect of stimuli with greater activation in the place (FP and UP) than object (FO and UO) trials was observed bilaterally in several medial temporo-occipito-parietal regions, including the caudal PCC (cPCC) and parahippocampal gyrus. The reverse comparison revealed greater activation in the lateral inferior occipito-temporal junctions and intraparietal sulci bilaterally. A significant main effect of familiarity with greater activation in the familiar (FP and FO) than unfamiliar (UP and UO) trials was observed in the mid-dorsal PCC (mPCC), retrosplenial cortex, posterior precuneus, and the left intraparietal sulcus. Activation specific to the FP trials (as assessed by the interaction) was observed in the right posterodorsal PCC (pPCC) only. Together with data from previous functional imaging studies, the results suggest a functional segregation of human PCC with differential involvement of pPCC in spatial representations of personally familiar places and of the mPCC and retrosplenial cortex in episodic retrieval of personally familiar places and objects. Activation of the left intraparietal sulcus may reflect retrieval of memories related to object manipulation.

Abstract: Although memory for spatial information has often been regarded as unitary, it may be divided into two distinct types: memory for the place where an individual experienced an event and memory for the location of an experienced event within a specific reference object. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the distinctions between the retrieval of these two types of spatial context memory. During scanning, subjects judged the room (Place task) in which a photograph had been presented or the location of the photograph on the computer display (R-L task) during the encoding phase. In a control task, subjects were asked to judge whether the photograph had been presented or not. The left middle frontal gyrus, lateral parietal and occipital regions, and bilateral precunei were found to be active during both the Place task and the R-L task compared with the control task. Critically, the place task, compared with the R-L task, was associated with activations in the right lateral prefrontal gyri, the posterior part of the left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral retrosplenial and lateral parieto-occipital areas, whereas the R-L task, relative to the place task, with activation only in the right lateral parietal cortex. These findings indicate that the retrieval processes of spatial context memory are not associated with a single network, but may vary and recruit different neural networks depending on the type of spatial information to be retrieved.

Abstract: Two streams have been identified in cortical visual processing: a ventral stream for form, color, and features, and a dorsal stream for spatial characteristics and motion. We investigated whether similar "what" and "where" dissociations of function exist for human somatosensory processing. Using identical stimuli and hand movements, subjects either performed tactile object recognition (TOR) and ignored location or performed tactile object localization (LOC) and ignored identity. A matched-movement control task separated activation associated with sensorimotor input from higher-level cognitive contributions. Results confirmed separate processing streams for TOR and LOC. TOR activated the frontal pole as well as bilateral inferior parietal and left prefrontal regions involved in tactile feature integration and naming. LOC activated bilateral superior parietal areas involved in spatial processing. The dissociation of object and spatial processing streams appears to be a modality general organizational principle in the brain.

Abstract: Neuropsychological research has consistently demonstrated that spatial attention can be anchored in one of several coordinate systems, including those defined with respect to an observer (viewer-centered), to the gravitational vector (environment-centered), or to individual objects (object-centered). In the present study, we used hemodynamic correlates of brain function to investigate the neural systems that mediate attentional control in two competing reference frames. Healthy volunteers were cued to locations defined in either viewer-centered or object-centered space to discriminate the shape of visual targets subsequently presented at the cued locations. Brain responses to attention-directing cues were quantified using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. A fronto-parietal control network was activated by attention-directing cues in both reference frames. Voluntary shifts of attention produced increased neural activity bilaterally in several cortical regions including the intraparietal sulcus, anterior cingulate cortex, and the frontal eye fields. Of special interest was the observation of hemispheric asymmetries in parietal cortex; there was significantly greater activity in left parietal cortex than in the right, but this asymmetry was more pronounced for object-centered shifts of attention, relative to viewer-centered shifts of attention. Measures of behavioral performance did not differ significantly between the two reference frames. We conclude that a largely overlapping, bilateral, cortical network mediates our ability to orient spatial attention in multiple coordinate systems, and that the left intraparietal sulcus plays an additional role for orienting in object-centered space. These results provide neuroimaging support for related claims based on findings of deficits in object-based orienting in patients with left parietal lesions.

Abstract: Repeated stimulus presentation (priming) is generally associated with a reduction in neuronal firing, macroscopically mirrored by a decrease in oscillatory electrophysiological markers as well as reduced hemodynamic responses. However, these repetition effects seem to be dependent on stimulus familiarity. We investigate the spatiotemporal correlates of repetition priming in cortical word-recognition networks and their modulation by stimulus familiarity (i.e., words vs pseudowords). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging results show reduced activation for repeated words in occipitotemporal cortical regions. Electroencephalogram recordings reveal a significant reduction of induced gamma-band responses (GBRs) between 200 and 350 ms after stimulus onset, accompanied by a decrease in phase synchrony between electrode positions. Pseudoword repetition, in contrast, leads to an activation increase in the same areas, to increased GBRs, and to an increased phase coupling. This spatiotemporal repetition by stimulus type interaction suggests that qualitatively distinct mechanisms are recruited during repetition priming of familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. Repetition of familiar stimuli leads to a "sharpening" of extrastriate object representations, whereas the repetition of unfamiliar stimuli results in the "formation" of a novel cortical network by means of synchronized oscillatory activity. In addition to isolating these mechanisms, the present study provides the first evidence for a possible link between induced electrophysiological and hemodynamic measures of brain activity.

Abstract: Recollecting the past and discriminating novel from familiar memoranda depend on poorly understood prefrontal cortical (PFC) mechanisms hypothesized to vary according to memory task (e.g. recollection versus novelty detection) and domain of targeted memories (e.g. perceptual versus conceptual). Using event-related fMRI, we demonstrate that recollecting conceptual or perceptual details surrounding object encounters similarly recruits left frontopolar and posterior PFC compared with detecting novel stimuli, suggesting that a domain-general control network is engaged during contextual remembering. In contrast, left anterior ventrolateral PFC coactivated with a left middle temporal region associated with semantic representation, and right ventrolateral PFC with bilateral occipito-temporal cortices associated with representing object form, depending on whether recollections were conceptual or perceptual. These PFC/posterior cortical dissociations suggest that during recollection, lateralized ventrolateral PFC mechanisms bias posterior conceptual or perceptual feature representations as a function of memory relevance, potentially improving the gain of bottom-up memory signals. Supporting this domain-sensitive biasing hypothesis, novelty detection also recruited right ventrolateral PFC and bilateral occipito-temporal cortices compared with conceptual recollection, suggesting that searching for novel objects heavily relies upon perceptual feature processing. Collectively, these data isolate task- from domain-sensitive PFC control processes strategically recruited in the service of episodic memory.

Abstract: Events are stored in our episodic memory in varying degrees of accessibility for conscious retrieval and combined with varying amounts of associated information. A crucial aspect of episodic memory is to bind information together, e.g. linking an object to a certain location. Spontaneous or experimenter-induced variance in the allocation of attentional resources during encoding critically determines the strength of the resulting memory trace especially for associative information as measured in subsequent memory tests. The neural correlates of associative memory encoding were investigated by lesion, PET- and fMRI-studies. So far no study aimed to assess the memory for associative information in a non-categorical way. Such a parametric assessment opens the possibility for a closer inspection of the relationship between brain activity and memory trace formation. We established a novel associative object-location memory paradigm, together with a parametric assessment of subsequent memory performance for spatial location which allows: (i) to determine if associative information is retrieved in a continuous or discontinuous manner during recognition and (ii) to investigate the relationship between activity during encoding and the resulting memory trace. Such correlations were observed in the occipital, parietal and the parahippocampal cortex, areas known to be involved in processing either objects and/or locations. The analysis of response functions revealed for the majority of areas involved in encoding a continuous relationship between brain activity during encoding and the confidence in a subsequent memory test.

Abstract: How does the amount of time for which we see an object influence the nature and content of its cortical representation? To address this question, we varied the duration of initial exposure to visual objects and then measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal and behavioral performance during a subsequent repeated presentation of these objects. We report a novel 'rise-and-fall' pattern relating exposure duration and the corresponding magnitude of fMRI cortical signal. Compared with novel objects, repeated objects elicited maximal cortical response reduction when initially presented for 250 ms. Counter-intuitively, initially seeing an object for a longer duration significantly reduced the magnitude of this effect. This 'rise-and-fall' pattern was also evident for the corresponding behavioral priming. To account for these findings, we propose that the earlier interval of an exposure to a visual stimulus results in a fine-tuning of the cortical response, while additional exposure promotes selection of a subset of key features for continued representation. These two independent mechanisms complement each other in shaping object representations with experience.

Abstract: Recognition of an object can be based on memory for specific details of a prior encounter with the object, or on a more general memory for the type of object previously encountered. Responding on the basis of general information alone can sometimes produce memory errors involving both distortion and forgetting, but little is known about the neural origins of general versus specific recognition. We extended the standard subsequent memory paradigm to examine whether neural activity at encoding predicts whether an object will subsequently elicit specific as compared to general memory. During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants viewed objects and made size judgments about them. Later, they viewed same, similar, and new objects, labeling each as "same," "similar," or "new." Specific recognition was indicated by a "same" response to a same object. By contrast, general, non-specific recognition was indicated by either a "same" response to a similar object (false memory) or a "similar" response to a same object (partial memory). As predicted, specific recognition, as compared to non-specific recognition, was associated with encoding-related activity in the right fusiform cortex, while non-specific recognition, as compared to forgetting, was associated with encoding-related activity in the left fusiform cortex. Furthermore, all successful recognition (specific and general), as compared to forgetting, was associated with encoding-related activity in bilateral fusiform cortex. These results suggest that the right fusiform cortex is associated with specific feature encoding, while the left fusiform cortex is involved in more general object encoding.

Abstract: Previous functional imaging experiments in humans showed activation increases in the posterior superior temporal gyrus and sulcus during observation of geometrical shapes whose movements appear intentional or goal-directed. We modeled a chase scenario between two objects, in which the chasing object used different strategies to reach the target object: The chaser either followed the target's path or appeared to predict its end position. Activation in the superior temporal gyrus of human observers was greater when the chaser adopted a predict rather than a follow strategy. Attending to the chaser's strategy induced slightly greater activation in the left superior temporal gyrus than attending to the outcome of the chase. These data implicate the superior temporal gyrus in the identification of objects displaying complex goal-directed motion.

Abstract: A model of normal attentional function, based on the concept of competitive parallel processing, is used to compare attentional deficits following parietal and frontal lobe lesions. Measurements are obtained for visual processing speed, capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM), spatial bias (bias to left or right hemifield) and top-down control (selective attention based on task relevance). The results show important differences, but also surprising similarities, in parietal and frontal lobe patients. For processing speed and VSTM, deficits are selectively associated with parietal lesions, in particular lesions of the temporoparietal junction. We discuss explanations based on either grey matter or white matter lesions. In striking contrast, measures of attentional weighting (spatial bias and top-down control) are predicted by simple lesion volume. We suggest that attentional weights reflect competition between broadly distributed object representations. Parietal and frontal mechanisms work together, both in weighting by location and weighting by task context.

Abstract: Visual attention may be voluntarily directed to particular locations or features (voluntary control), or it may be captured by salient stimuli, such as the abrupt appearance of a new perceptual object (stimulus-driven control). Most often, however, the deployment of attention is the result of a dynamic interplay between voluntary attentional control settings (e.g., based on prior knowledge about a target's location or color) and the degree to which stimuli in the visual scene match these voluntary control settings. Consequently, nontarget items in the scene that share a defining feature with the target of visual search can capture attention, a phenomenon termed contingent attentional capture. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that attentional capture by target-colored distractors is accompanied by increased cortical activity in corresponding regions of retinotopically organized visual cortex. Concurrent activation in the temporoparietal junction and ventral frontal cortex suggests that these regions coordinate voluntary and stimulus-driven attentional control settings to determine which stimuli effectively compete for attention.

Abstract: The cerebellum has traditionally been associated with motor movements but recent studies suggest its involvement with fine timing, sensory analysis and cognition. Much of the new data comes from neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and PET, which have high spatial resolution and show that for even simple stimuli many cerebellar and cortical areas are involved. We use examples from recent studies to demonstrate that magnetic field tomography (MFT) offers a new and powerful tool for studying cerebellar function through real time localization of cortical, brainstem and cerebellar activations over timescales ranging from a fraction of a millisecond to seconds, minutes and hours. The examples include demonstration of cerebellar activations along well-established anatomical pathways during saccades and the visualization of the ascending medullar volley after median nerve stimulation. MFT analysis of single trial MEG signals elicited by the presentation of faces in emotion and object recognition tasks, show changes in cerebellar activation between schizophrenics and normal subjects in agreement with proposals for disturbed cerebellar function in schizophrenia. The ability of MFT to identify cerebellar, brainstem and cortical activations in real time can add new insights about dynamics of brain activity to the recent findings about cerebellar function from PET and fMRI.

Abstract: Perceptual continuity is an important aspect of our experience of the visual world. In this study, we focus on an example of perceptual continuity involving the maintenance of figure-ground segregation despite the removal of binding cues that initiated the segregation. Fragmented line drawings of objects were superimposed on a background of randomly oriented lines. Global forms could be discriminated from the background based on differences in motion or differences in color/brightness. Furthermore, perception of a global form persisted after the binding cue had been removed. A comparison between the persistence of forms constructed from motion or color demonstrated that both forms produced persistence after the object defining cues were removed. Functional imaging showed a gradual increase in the persistence of brain activity in the lower visual areas (V1, V2, VP), which reached significance in V4v and peaked in the lateral occipital area. There was no difference in the location of persistence for color- or motion-defined forms. These results suggest that the retention of a global percept is an emerging property of the ventral visual processing stream and the maintenance of grouped visual elements is independent of cue type. We postulated that perceptual persistence depends on a system of perceptual memory reflecting the state of perceptual organization.

Abstract: Perceptual load of an attended task influences the processing of irrelevant background stimuli. In a series of behavioral, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments we examined the influence of working memory (WM) load related to a relevant visual stimulus on the processing of irrelevant backgrounds. We further addressed two open questions about the mechanism of load-dependent modulation: (i) is this modulation dependent on regional activity (i.e. phasic)? (ii) At what processing stage does this modulation take place? Load was manipulated by a WM task and concurrently the processing of irrelevant visual objects was assessed with fMRI and EEG. To examine the dependency of this modulation on intrinsic activity, we varied the activity level of visual areas by presenting objects with different levels of degradation. Activity in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) increased with object visibility and was phasically modulated by WM load. Event related potentials revealed that this phasic modulation occurred approximately 170 ms after stimulus onset, indicative of an early selection under high load. The results indicate a phasic modulatory effect of WM load on visual object processing in the LOC that is comparable to the effects found for perceptual load manipulations.

Abstract: The prefrontal cortex supports many cognitive abilities, which humans share to some degree with monkeys. The specialized functions of the prefrontal cortex depend both on the nature of its inputs from other brain regions and on distinctive aspects of local processing. We used functional MRI to compare prefrontal activity between monkey and human subjects when they viewed identical images of objects, either intact or scrambled. Visual object-related activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex was observed in both species, but was stronger in monkeys than in humans, both in magnitude (factors 2-3) and in spatial extent (fivefold or more as a percentage of prefrontal volume). This difference was observed for two different stimulus sets, at two field strengths, and over a range of tasks. These results suggest that there may be more volitional control over visual processing in humans than in monkeys.

Systems Integration
Abstract: A Windows-based, object-oriented application system for segmentation and analysis of electron magnetic resonance (EMR) images is described. The integrated system is developed for better recognition of regions of interest (ROI) in murine EMR images. The system combines the clustering method of color segmentation with boundary detection, for efficient segmentation of regions of interest in EMR images. Initially, the red/green/blue (RGB) color space is converted into spherical coordinates transform (SCT) space. Color quantization is then achieved by center split algorithm applied on the color dimensions of the SCT space. Subsequently, Laplacian boundary detection operator is used to extract the contours of the ROI from the variegated coloring information. The system is implemented in Visual C++ and tested on temporal EMR color images of mouse. The system performs well giving perceptually reasonable segmentation of tumor, kidney and bladder of the mouse image. Experimental results with extensive set of EMR color images demonstrate the efficacy of the system developed.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that object and place processing are neuroanatomically dissociated in ventral visual areas under conditions of passive viewing. It has also been shown that the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus mediate the integration of objects with background scenes in functional imaging studies, but only when encoding or retrieval processes have been directed toward the relevant stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance adaptation, we demonstrated that object, background scene, and contextual integration of selectively repeated objects and background scenes could be dissociated during the passive viewing of naturalistic pictures involving object-scene pairings. Specifically, bilateral fusiform areas showed adaptation to object repetition, regardless of whether the associated scene was novel or repeated, suggesting sensitivity to object processing. Bilateral parahippocampal regions showed adaptation to background scene repetition, regardless of whether the focal object was novel or repeated, suggesting selectivity for background scene processing. Finally, bilateral parahippocampal regions distinct from those involved in scene processing and the right hippocampus showed adaptation only when the unique pairing of object with background scene was repeated, suggesting that these regions perform binding operations.

Abstract: In the present object recognition study, we examined the relationship between brain activation and four behavioral measures: error rate, reaction time, observer sensitivity, and response bias. Subjects perceptually matched object pairs in which structural similarity (SS), an index of structural differentiation, and exposure duration (DUR), an index of task difficulty, were manipulated. The SS manipulation affected the fMRI signal in the left anterior fusiform and parietal cortices, which in turn reflected a bias to respond same. Conversely, an SS-modulated fMRI signal in the right middle frontal gyrus reflected a bias to respond different. The DUR manipulation affected the fMRI signal in occipital and posterior fusiform regions, which in turn reflected greater sensitivity, longer reaction times, and greater accuracy. These findings demonstrate that the regions most strongly implicated in processing object shape (SS-modulated regions) are associated with response bias, whereas regions that are not directly involved in shape processing are associated with successful recognition performance.

Abstract: The neural system underlying face perception must represent the unchanging features of a face that specify identity, as well as the changeable aspects of a face that facilitate social communication. However, the way information about faces is represented in the brain remains controversial. In this study, we used fMR adaptation (the reduction in fMRI activity that follows the repeated presentation of identical images) to ask how different face- and object-selective regions of visual cortex contribute to specific aspects of face perception. We report that activity in the face-selective region of the fusiform gyrus (FG) was reduced following repeated presentations of the same face. Adaptation in this area was not sensitive to changes in image size, but was sensitive to changes in viewpoint. In contrast, face-selective regions in the superior temporal lobe failed to adapt to identical presentations of the same face, but showed an increased response when the same face was shown from different viewpoints and with different expressions. These results reveal a largely size-invariant neural representation in the inferior temporal lobe that could be involved in the recognition of facial identity, and a separate face-selective region in the superior temporal lobe that could be used to detect changeable aspects of faces. The absence of fMR-adaptation in object-selective regions of visual cortex challenges the idea that a more distributed network of areas is used to represent information about faces.

Abstract: While the lateral occipital complex (LOC) has been shown to be implicated in object recognition, it is unclear whether this brain area is responsive to low-level stimulus-driven features or high-level representational processes. We used scrambled shape-from-motion displays to disambiguate the presence of contours from figure-ground segregation and to measure the strength of the binding process for shapes without contours. We found persisting brain activation in the LOC for scrambled displays after the motion stopped indicating that this brain area subserves and maintains figure-ground segregation processes, a low-level function in the object processing hierarchy. In our second experiment, we found that the figure-ground segregation process has some form of spatial constancy indicating top-down influences. The persisting activation after the motion stops suggests an intermediate role in object recognition processes for this brain area and might provide further evidence for the idea that the lateral occipital complex subserves mnemonic functions mediating between iconic and short-term memory.

Abstract: Findings from single-cell recording studies suggest that a comparison of the outputs of different pools of selectively tuned lower-level sensory neurons may be a general mechanism by which higher-level brain regions compute perceptual decisions. For example, when monkeys must decide whether a noisy field of dots is moving upward or downward, a decision can be formed by computing the difference in responses between lower-level neurons sensitive to upward motion and those sensitive to downward motion. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging and a categorization task in which subjects decide whether an image presented is a face or a house to test whether a similar mechanism is also at work for more complex decisions in the human brain and, if so, where in the brain this computation might be performed. Activity within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is greater during easy decisions than during difficult decisions, covaries with the difference signal between face- and house-selective regions in the ventral temporal cortex, and predicts behavioural performance in the categorization task. These findings show that even for complex object categories, the comparison of the outputs of different pools of selectively tuned neurons could be a general mechanism by which the human brain computes perceptual decisions.

Abstract: Monkeys with neurotoxic (ibotenic acid) damage to the hippocampal formation and unoperated controls were trained on two sets of transverse patterning problems (A+/B-, B+/C-, C+/A-, and D+/E-, E+/F-, F+/D-) and a delayed nonmatching-to-location paradigm (DNML) with delays of 10s, 30s, 120s, and 600s. Hippocampal lesions produced a size- and area-dependent impairment on transverse patterning. Damage largely limited to the right hippocampus in one subject had no effect on performance on the task. Of the remaining four subjects, two with hippocampal damage greater than 40% bilaterally were unable to solve the two transverse patterning sets, but could solve the linear set of discriminations (A+/B-, B+/C-, C+/X-). The two remaining operated animals were impaired in acquisition of both sets, but were eventually able to solve one of the two transverse patterning discrimination sets. All five operated monkeys were impaired relative to normal controls on DNML, but not on the standard delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) version with trial-unique objects. The results confirm our previous findings (Alvarado et al., Hippocampus 12:421-433, 2002) using aspiration lesions of the hippocampal formation and strengthen the view that the hippocampal formation is critical for object and spatial relational memory.

Abstract: The absence of object information very often asks for considerable human assistance in medical image segmentation. Many interactive two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation methods have been proposed, but their response time to user's actions should be considerably reduced to make them viable from the practical point of view. We circumvent this problem in the framework of the image foresting transform (IFT)--a general tool for the design of image operators based on connectivity--by introducing a new algorithm (DIFT) to compute sequences of IFTs in a differential way. We instantiate the DIFT algorithm for watershed-based and fuzzy-connected segmentations under two paradigms (single-object and multiple-object) and evaluate the efficiency gains of both approaches with respect to their linear-time implementation based on the nondifferential IFT. We show that the DIFT algorithm provides efficiency gains from 10 to 17, reducing the user's waiting time for segmentation with 3-D visualization on a common PC from 19-36 s to 2-3 s. We also show that the multiple-object approach is more efficient than the single-object paradigm for both segmentation methods.

Abstract: OBJECT: Electrocortical stimulation mapping is regarded as the gold standard of intraoperative mapping for predicting functional outcomes. Nevertheless, methodologies across institutions are inconsistent. Although many vary and maximize stimulation currents at each cortical site, some use a single current level to map the entire exposed cortex. The former comes at the cost of possibly inducing additional afterdischarge activity. The authors retrospectively reviewed their eperience with intraoperative electrocortical stimulation mapping to characterize variability of both mapping and afterdischarge thresholds. METHODS: Seventeen patients satisfied the study inclusion criteria. Significant variability in mapping thresholds was identified within individuals and across the patient population. Moreover, a statistically significant difference in mapping thresholds was demonstrated between the frontal and parietal/temporal lobes (p = 0.007, one-way analysis of variance). The authors report a surprisingly high incidence of afterdischarge during mapping, wide variability in afterdischarge thresholds within individuals and across the study population, and mapping thresholds regularly exceeding afterdischarge thresholds in neighboring cortex. Differences in afterdischarge thresholds across lobes only approached significance (p = 0.086). CONCLUSIONS: To maximize identification of eloquent cortices in some clinical situations, it may be advantageous to maximize currents at each cortical site regardless of adjacent afterdischarge threshold rather than to map the entire exposed cortex at a single current level. Moreover, the current findings highlight the need for electrocorticography during electrocortical stimulation mapping, both to identify when afterdischarges occur and to verify stimulation by recording stimu lation artifacts. The advantages and limitations of maximizing currents at each cortical site as well as mapping at a single current level are discussed.

Abstract: For medical image analysis issues where the domain mappings between images involve large geometrical shape changes, such as the cases of nonrigid motion recovery and inter-object image registration, the finite element methods exhibit considerable loss of accuracy when the elements in the mesh become extremely skewed or compressed. Therefore, algorithmically difficult and computationally expensive remeshing procedures must be performed in order to alleviate the problem. We present a general representation and computation framework which is purely based on the sampling nodal points and does not require the construction of mesh structure of the analysis domain. This meshfree strategy can more naturally handle very large object deformation and domain discontinuity problems. Because of its intrinsic h-p adaptivity, the meshfree framework can achieve desired numerical accuracy through adaptive node and polynomial shape function refinement with minimum extra computational expense. We focus on one of the more robust meshfree efforts, the element free Galerkin method, through the moving least square approximation and the Galerkin weak form formulation, and demonstrate its relevancy to medical image analysis problems. Specifically, we show the results of applying this strategy to physically motivated multiframe motion analysis, using synthetic data for accuracy assessment and for comparison to finite element results, and using canine magnetic resonance tagging and phase contrast images for cardiac kinematics recovery.

Abstract: This paper describes a Multi-View Active Appearance Model (AAM) for coherent segmentation of multiple cardiac views. Cootes' AAM framework was adapted by considering shapes and intensities from multiple views, while eliminating trivial difference in object pose in different views. This way, the coherence in organ shape and intensities between different views is modeled, and utilized during image search. The method is validated in two substantially different and novel applications: segmentation of combined end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular X-ray angiograms, and simultaneous segmentation of a combination of four chamber, two chamber and short-axis cardiac MR views.

Abstract: The correspondence problem is of high relevance in the construction and use of statistical models. Statistical models are used for a variety of medical application, e.g. segmentation, registration and shape analysis. In this paper, we present comparative studies in three anatomical structures of four different correspondence establishing methods. The goal in all of the presented studies is a model-based application. We have analyzed both the direct correspondence via manually selected landmarks as well as the properties of the model implied by the correspondences, in regard to compactness, generalization and specificity. The studied methods include a manually initialized subdivision surface (MSS) method and three automatic methods that optimize the object parameterization: SPHARM, MDL and the covariance determinant (DetCov) method. In all studies, DetCov and MDL showed very similar results. The model properties of DetCov and MDL were better than SPHARM and MSS. The results suggest that for modeling purposes the best of the studied correspondence method are MDL and DetCov.

Abstract: A unique opportunity to understand genetic determinants of cognition is offered by Williams syndrome (WS), a well-characterized hemideletion on chromosome 7q11.23 that causes extreme, specific weakness in visuospatial construction (the ability to visualize an object as a set of parts or construct a replica). Using multimodal neuroimaging, we identified a neural mechanism underlying the WS visuoconstructive deficit. Hierarchical assessment of visual processing with fMRI showed isolated hypoactivation in WS in the parietal portion of the dorsal stream. In the immediately adjacent parietooccipital/intraparietal sulcus, structural neuroimaging showed a gray matter volume reduction in participants with WS. Path analysis demonstrated that the functional abnormalities could be attributed to impaired input from this structurally altered region. Our observations confirm a longstanding hypothesis about dorsal stream dysfunction in WS, demonstrate effects of a localized abnormality on visual information processing in humans, and define a systems-level phenotype for mapping genetic determinants of visuoconstructive function.

Abstract: Most of the approaches dedicated to automatic morphometry rely on a point-by-point strategy based on warping each brain toward a reference coordinate system. In this paper, we describe an alternative object-based strategy dedicated to the cortex. This strategy relies on an artificial neuroanatomist performing automatic recognition of the main cortical sulci and parcellation of the cortical surface into gyral patches. A set of shape descriptors, which can be compared across subjects, is then attached to the sulcus and gyrus related objects segmented by this process. The framework is used to perform a study of 142 brains of the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) database. This study reveals some correlates of handedness on the size of the sulci located in motor areas, which was not detected previously using standard voxel based morphometry.

Abstract: A novel method for the segmentation of multiple objects from three-dimensional (3-D) medical images using interobject constraints is presented. Our method is motivated by the observation that neighboring structures have consistent locations and shapes that provide configurations and context that aid in segmentation. We define a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework using the constraining information provided by neighboring objects to segment several objects simultaneously. We introduce a representation for the joint density function of the neighbor objects, and define joint probability distributions over the variations of the neighboring shape and position relationships of a set of training images. In order to estimate the MAP shapes of the objects, we formulate the model in terms of level set functions, and compute the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The contours evolve both according to the neighbor prior information and the image gray level information. This method is useful in situations where there is limited interobject information as opposed to robust global atlases. In addition, we compare our level set representation of the object shape to the point distribution model. Results and validation from experiments on synthetic data and medical imagery in two-dimensional and 3-D are demonstrated.

Abstract: Haxby et al. [Science 293 (2001) 2425] recently argued that category-related responses in the ventral temporal (VT) lobe during visual object identification were overlapping and distributed in topography. This observation contrasts with prevailing views that object codes are focal and localized to specific areas such as the fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. We provide a critical test of Haxby's hypothesis using a neural network (NN) classifier that can detect more general topographic representations and achieves 83% correct generalization performance on patterns of voxel responses in out-of-sample tests. Using voxel-wise sensitivity analysis we show that substantially the same VT lobe voxels contribute to the classification of all object categories, suggesting the code is combinatorial. Moreover, we found no evidence for local single category representations. The neural network representations of the voxel codes were sensitive to both category and superordinate level features that were only available implicitly in the object categories.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans has revealed increases in brain activity associated with various mental activities that are task-dependent. However, changes in brain activity have been dependent on baseline as well as experimental tasks. In the present study, fMRI was applied to investigate the most appropriate baseline task, picture naming or passive viewing of nonsense objects, to isolate syntactic processes related to 14.7-s blocks of silent sentence generation in 10 neurologically normal adults. The aim of this comparison was to determine the most suitable baseline task for the purpose of elucidating changes in the neural substrates of sentence generation following therapy for syntax production problems. Use of naming but not passive object viewing as a baseline task obscured activity in Broca's area, a region previously shown to be involved in syntactic processing. These results suggest that passive viewing of nonsense objects serves as a more appropriate baseline comparison than object naming for investigating sentence processing.

Abstract: A common notion is that object perception is a necessary precursor to scene perception. Behavioral evidence suggests, however, that scene perception can operate independently of object perception. Further, neuroimaging has revealed a specialized human cortical area for viewing scenes that is anatomically distinct from areas activated by viewing objects. Here we show that an individual with visual form agnosia, D.F., who has a profound deficit in object recognition but spared color and visual texture perception, could still classify scenes and that she was fastest when the scenes were presented in the appropriate color. When scenes were presented as black-and-white images, she made a large number of errors in classification. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed selective activation in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) when D.F. viewed scenes. Unlike control observers, D.F. demonstrated higher activation in the PPA for scenes presented in the appropriate color than for black-and-white versions. The results demonstrate that an individual with profound form vision deficits can still use visual texture and color to classify scenes-and that this intact ability is reflected in differential activation of the PPA with colored versions of scenes.

Abstract: Here we examined the level of the lateral occipital (LO) area within the processing stream of the ventral visual cortex. An important determinant of an area's level of processing is whether it codes visual elements on both sides of the visual field, as do higher visual areas, or prefers those in the contralateral visual field, as do early visual areas. The former would suggest that LO, on one side, combines bilateral visual elements into a whole, while the latter suggests that it codes only the parts of forms. We showed that LO has a relative preference for visual objects in the contralateral visual field. LO responses were influenced by attention. However, relative changes in LO activity caused by changes in object location were preserved even when attention was shifted away from the objects to moving random dot patterns on the opposite side. Our data offer a new view on LO as an intermediate, but not a high-level, visual area in which neurons are driven by visual input and spatial attention in a multiplicative fashion.

Abstract: Semantic Dementia (SD) represents a rare variant of presenile primary degenerative diseases of "frontotemporal lobar degenerations" (FTLD). SD is characterized by anterior-temporal atrophy and a selective semantic deficit. Neuropsychological impairment either bears on fluent aphasia with marked naming and comprehension difficulties or on a disorder of object recognition or on both. Behavioural alterations such as stereotyped behaviour and change in food preference become prominent as the disease progresses and are interpreted as a correlative for the pathological spreading to frontal structures. Since SD is often misclassified as Alzheimer's disease (AD), but calls for a different management, diagnostic consensus criteria by Neary and colleagues are depicted. The neuropsychological profile is described in detail and complemented by a case report. Implications from the dissociation of disturbed memory systems of SD (semantic) and AD (episodic) for models of long-term memory are discussed in terms of connectivity in the medial temporal lobe. SD can contribute to a better understanding of the structure and organisation of the semantic system.

Abstract: It has been suggested that category-specific recognition disorders for natural objects may reflect that natural objects are more structurally (visually) similar than artefacts and therefore more difficult to recognize following brain damage. On this account one might expect a positive relationship between blood flow and structural similarity in areas involved in visual object recognition. Contrary to this expectation we report a negative relationship in that identification of articles of clothing cause more extensive activation than identification of vegetables/fruit and animals even though items from the categories of animals and vegetables/fruit are rated as more structurally similar than items from the category of articles of clothing. Given that this pattern cannot be explained in terms of a tradeoff between activation and accuracy, we interpret these findings within a model where the matching of visual forms to memory incorporates two operations: (i) the integration of stored object features into whole object representations (integral units), and (ii) the competition between activated integral units for selection (i.e. identification). In addition, we suggest that these operations are differentially affected by structural similarity in that high structural similarity may be beneficial for the integration of stored features into integral units, thus explaining the greater activation found with articles of clothing, whereas it may be harmful for the selection process proper because a greater range of candidate integral units will be activated and compete for selection, thus explaining the higher error rate associated with animals. We evaluate the model based on previous evidence from both normal subjects and patients with category-specific disorders and argue that this model can help reconcile otherwise conflicting data.

Abstract: Information on normal functional organization and development of the ventral processing stream in 5- to 11-year-old children is minimal. The present fMRI study identified neural correlates for face and object processing in children aged 5-8 and 9-11 years, with data from a similar adult study used for comparison. All age groups showed face-preferential activation in the ventral processing stream, but adults and children aged 9-11 years showed face-preferential loci near the classically defined fusiform face area, whereas children aged 5-8 years showed this activation in the posterior ventral processing stream. In addition, the degree of category-selectivity in other brain regions increased with age. Collectively, these developmental changes may reflect fine-tuning in visual recognition processes based on learning and experience.

Abstract: We studied time course and cerebral localisation of word, object, and face recognition using event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localisation techniques. To compare activation rates of these three categories, we used degraded images that easily pop out without any change in the physical features of the stimuli, once the meaning is revealed. Comparisons before and after identification show additional periods of activation beginning at 100 msec for faces and at around 200 msec for objects and words. For faces, this activation occurs predominantly in right temporal areas, whereas for objects, the specific time period gives rise to bilateral posterior but right dominant foci. Finally, words show a maximum area of activation in the left temporooccipital area at their specific time period. These results provide unequivocal evidence that when effects of low-level visual features are circumvented, faces, objects, and words are not only distinct in terms of their anatomic routes, but also in terms of their times of processing.

Abstract: The traditional view that the cerebellum is involved only in the control of movements has been changed recently. It has been suggested that the human cerebellum is involved in cognition and language. Likewise, besides cortical activity in sensorimotor and visual areas, an increased global activation of the cerebellum has been revealed during Braille reading in blind subjects. Our purpose was to investigate whether there is cerebellar activation during Braille reading by blind subjects other than sensorimotor activation related to finger movements. Early blind and normal sighted subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during Braille reading, tactile discrimination of nonsense dots, dots forming symbols, and finger tapping. The experiments were done in block design. Echo planar imaging sequences were carried out on a 1.5-T MR scanner. All blind individuals reading Braille showed robust activation of the posterior and lateral aspects of cerebellar hemispheral lobules Crus I bilaterally but more predominately on the right side. Additionally, activation was present in the medial cerebellum within lobules IV, V, and VIIIA, predominantly on the right. Discriminating nonsense dots did not reveal any activation of Crus I, but did reveal activation within the medial part of lobules IV, V, and VIIIA, predominately on the right. Analysis of sighted subjects during reading of printed text revealed activation of the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere in Crus I bilaterally, predominantly on the right. Tactile analysis of dots representing symbols revealed an activation in lobules IV and VIII and in right Crus II but not in Crus I. In conclusion, parts of cerebellar activation during Braille reading in blind subjects (i.e., within lobules IV, V, and VIII) overlap with the known hand representation within the cerebellum and are likely related to the sensorimotor part of the task. Cerebellar activation during Braille reading within bilateral Crus I may be due to language processes or inner speech similar to those found during text reading in normal sighted subjects. Object recognition did not account for Crus I activation.

Abstract: How many neurons participate in the representation of a single visual image? Answering this question is critical for constraining biologically inspired models of object recognition, which vary greatly in their assumptions from few "grandmother cells" to numerous neurons in widely distributed networks. Functional imaging techniques, such as fMRI, provide an opportunity to explore this issue, since they allow the simultaneous detection of the entire neuronal population responding to each stimulus. Several studies have shown that fMRI BOLD signal is approximately proportional to neuronal activity. However, since it provides an indirect measure of this activity, obtaining a realistic estimate of the number of activated neurons requires several intervening steps. Here, we used the extensive knowledge of primate V1 to yield a conservative estimate of the ratio between hemodynamic response and neuronal firing. This ratio was then used, in addition to several cautious assumptions, to assess the number of neurons responding to a single-object image in the entire visual cortex and particularly in object-related areas. Our results show that at least a million neurons in object-related cortex and about two hundred million neurons in the entire visual cortex are involved in the representation of a single-object image.

Abstract: Visual agnosia has been well studied by anatomical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies. However, functional changes in the brain have been rarely assessed by electrophysiological methods. We carried out electrophysiological examinations on a 23-year-old man with associative visual agnosia, prosopagnosia and cerebral achromatopsia to evaluate the higher brain dysfunctions of visual recognition. Electrophysiological methods consisted of achromatic, chromatic and category-specific visual evoked potentials (CS-VEPs), and event-related potentials (ERPs) with color and motion discrimination tasks. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed large white matter lesions in the bilateral temporo-occipital lobes involving the lingual and fusiform gyri (V4) and inferior longitudinal fasciculi due to multiple sclerosis. Examinations including CS-VEPs demonstrated dysfunctions of face and object perception while sparing semantic word perception after primary visual cortex (V1) in the ventral pathway. ERPs showed abnormal color perception in the ventral pathway with normal motion perception in the dorsal pathway. These electrophysiological findings were consistent with lesions in the ventral pathway that were detected by clinical and neuroimaging findings. Therefore, CS-VEPs and ERPs with color and motion discrimination tasks are useful methods for assessing the functional changes of visual recognition such as visual agnosia.

Abstract: The present study sought to assess neural correlates of implicit identification of objects by means of fMRI, using tasks that require matching of the physical properties of objects. Behavioural data suggests that there is automatic access to object identity when observers attend to a physical property of the form of an object (e.g. the object's orientation) and no evidence for semantic processing when subjects attend to colour. We evaluated whether, in addition to neural areas associated with decisions to specific perceptual properties, areas associated with access to semantic information were activated when tasks demanded processing of the global configuration of pictures. We used two perceptual matching tasks based on the global orientation or on the colour of line drawings. Our results confirmed behavioural data. Activations in the inferior occipital cortex, fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in both tasks (orientation and colour) account for perceptual and structural processing involved in each task. In contrast, activations in the posterior and medial parts of the fusiform gyrus, shown to be involved in explicit semantic judgements, were more pronounced in the orientation-matching task, suggesting that semantic information from the pictures is processed in an implicit way even when not required by the task. Thus, this study suggests that cortical regions usually involved in explicit semantic processing are also activated when implicit processing of objects occurs.

Abstract: As people find their way through their environment, objects at navigationally relevant locations can serve as crucial landmarks. The parahippocampal gyrus has previously been shown to be involved in object and scene recognition. In the present study, we investigated the neural representation of navigationally relevant locations. Healthy human adults viewed a route through a virtual museum with objects placed at intersections (decision points) or at simple turns (non-decision points). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired during subsequent recognition of the objects in isolation. Neural activity in the parahippocampal gyrus reflected the navigational relevance of an object's location in the museum. Parahippocampal responses were selectively increased for objects that occurred at decision points, independent of attentional demands. This increase occurred for forgotten as well as remembered objects, showing implicit retrieval of navigational information. The automatic storage of relevant object location in the parahippocampal gyrus provides a part of the neural mechanism underlying successful navigation.

Abstract: OBJECT: In this study the authors evaluated the sensitivity and selectivity of a noninvasive language mapping procedure based on magnetoencephalography (MEG), for determining hemispheric dominance for language functions. METHODS: Magnetic activation profiles of the brain were obtained from 100 surgical candidates (age range 8-56 years) with medically intractable seizure disorder by using a whole-head MEG system within the context of a word recognition task. The degree of language-specific activity was indexed according to the number of consecutive sources (modeled as single, moving current dipoles) in perisylvian brain areas. Only activity sources that were observed with a high degree of spatial and temporal overlap in two split-half data sets were used to compute the MEG laterality index. Independently, all patients underwent Wada testing for the determination of hemispheric dominance for language. Independent clinical judgments based on MEG and Wada data showed a high degree of concordance (87%). Magnetoencephalography laterality judgments had an overall sensitivity of 98%, but a lower selectivity of 83%, which was due to the fact that MEG detected more activity in the nondominant hemisphere than was predicted based on the Wada test. A number of objective criteria were derived based on this large patient series to ensure data quality and bolster the clinical usefulness of MEG for language mapping. CONCLUSIONS: Although the availability of MEG is still limited across epilepsy surgery centers, this study method may be substituted for the Wada procedure in assessing hemispheric dominance for language in select cases.

Abstract: Findings from neurophysiology have supported the view that visual working memory (WM) relies on modulation of activity in object-selective populations of neurons in inferior temporal cortex. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated whether similar mechanisms support human visual working memory encoding and maintenance processes. We identified regions in inferior temporal cortex that exhibited category-specific responses during perception of faces (fusiform face area [FFA]) or scenes (parahippocampal place area [PPA]) and investigated whether activity in these regions would be modulated by demands to actively encode and maintain faces and scenes. Results showed that independent of perceptual stimulation, the FFA and PPA exhibited greater encoding- and maintenance-related activity when their favored stimulus was relevant to the recognition task. In contrast, maintenance-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) was modulated by memory load, regardless of the type of information that was task relevant. These results are consistent with the view that visual working memory encoding and maintenance processes are implemented through modulation of inferior temporal activity by prefrontal cortex.

Abstract: Higher order cognition depends on the ability to recall information from memory and hold it in mind to guide future behavior. To specify the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during the performance of a visual associative memory task and a visual working memory task. Activity within category-selective subregions of inferior temporal cortex reflected the type of information that was actively maintained during both the associative memory and working memory tasks. In addition, activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was specifically enhanced during associative memory retrieval. These data are consistent with the view that the active maintenance of visual information is supported by activation of object representations in inferior temporal cortex, but that goal-directed associative memory retrieval additionally depends on top-down signals from the anterior prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Semantic memory is thought to consist of category-specific representations of knowledge that may be selectively compromised in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, but this has been difficult to demonstrate reliably across object categories. METHODS: The authors evaluated performance on several simple measures requiring number representations (including addition and magnitude judgments of single digits), and on a task that requires object representations (an object naming task) in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD; n = 13) and semantic dementia (SD; n = 15). They also examined regional cortical atrophy using voxel-based morphometric analyses of high resolution structural MRI in subgroups of five CBD patients and three SD patients. RESULTS: CBD patients were consistently more impaired on simple addition and magnitude judgment tasks requiring number representations compared to object representations. Impaired performance with numbers in CBD was associated with cortical atrophy in right parietal cortex. By comparison, SD patients demonstrated a greater impairment on a naming task requiring object representations relative to their performance on measures involving number representations. This was associated with left anterior temporal cortical atrophy. CONCLUSION: The cognitive and neuroanatomic dissociations between CBD and SD are consistent with the hypothesis that number and object representations constitute distinct domains in semantic memory, and these domains appear to be associated with distinct neural substrates.

Abstract: A number of studies in rodents and monkeys report a distinction between the contributions of the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex to memory, such that the hippocampus is crucial for spatial memory whereas the perirhinal cortex has a pivotal role in perception and memory for visual objects. To determine if there is such a distinction in humans, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to compare the medial temporal lobe responses to changes in object identity and spatial configurations of objects. We found evidence for the predicted distinction between hippocampal and perirhinal cortical activations, although part of the hippocampus was also activated by identification of novel objects. Additionally, an anterior-posterior activation gradient emerged inside the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. The anterior hippocampus, perirhinal cortex and anterior parahippocampal cortex are involved in perception of contextually novel objects, whereas the posterior hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal cortex are involved in processing of novel arrangements of familiar objects. These results demonstrate that there is a functional dissociation between processing of novel object identities and new spatial locations of objects among the subregions of medial temporal lobe structures in humans also.

Abstract: How objects are represented and processed in the brain is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience. Previous studies have shown that knowledge of objects is represented in a feature-based distributed neural system primarily involving occipital and temporal cortical regions. Research with nonhuman primates suggest that these features are structured in a hierarchical system with posterior neurons in the inferior temporal cortex representing simple features and anterior neurons in the perirhinal cortex representing complex conjunctions of features (Bussey & Saksida, 2002; Murray & Bussey, 1999). On this account, the perirhinal cortex plays a crucial role in object identification by integrating information from different sensory systems into more complex polymodal feature conjunctions. We tested the implications of these claims for human object processing in an event-related fMRI study in which we presented colored pictures of common objects for 19 subjects to name at two levels of specificity - basic and domain. We reasoned that domain-level naming requires access to a coarser-grained representation of objects, thus involving only posterior regions of the inferior temporal cortex. In contrast, basic-level naming requires finer-grained discrimination to differentiate between similar objects, and thus should involve anterior temporal regions, including the perirhinal cortex. We found that object processing always activated the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, irrespective of the task, whereas the perirhinal cortex was only activated when the task required finer-grained discriminations. These results suggest that the same kind of hierarchical structure, which has been proposed for object processing in the monkey temporal cortex, functions in the human.

Abstract: In the paper, we discuss the importance of network interactions between brain regions in mediating performance of sensorimotor and cognitive tasks, including those associated with language processing. Functional neuroimaging, especially PET and fMRI, provide data that are obtained essentially simultaneously from much of the brain, and thus are ideal for enabling one to assess interregional functional interactions. Two ways to use these types of data to assess network interactions are presented. First, using PET, we demonstrate that anterior and posterior perisylvian language areas have stronger functional connectivity during spontaneous narrative production than during other less linguistically demanding production tasks. Second, we show how one can use large-scale neural network modeling to relate neural activity to the hemodynamically-based data generated by fMRI and PET. We review two versions of a model of object processing - one for visual and one for auditory objects. The regions comprising the models include primary and secondary sensory cortex, association cortex in the temporal lobe, and prefrontal cortex. Each model incorporates specific assumptions about how neurons in each of these areas function, and how neurons in the different areas are interconnected with each other. Each model is able to perform a delayed match-to-sample task for simple objects (simple shapes for the visual model; tonal contours for the auditory model). We find that the simulated electrical activities in each region are similar to those observed in nonhuman primates performing analogous tasks, and the absolute values of the simulated integrated synaptic activity in each brain region match human fMRI/PET data. Thus, this type of modeling provides a way to understand the neural bases for the sensorimotor and cognitive tasks of interest.

Abstract: We investigated whether the topographically organized, category-related patterns of neural response in the ventral visual pathway are a representation of sensory images or a more abstract representation of object form that is not dependent on sensory modality. We used functional MRI to measure patterns of response evoked during visual and tactile recognition of faces and manmade objects in sighted subjects and during tactile recognition in blind subjects. Results showed that visual and tactile recognition evoked category-related patterns of response in a ventral extrastriate visual area in the inferior temporal gyrus that were correlated across modality for manmade objects. Blind subjects also demonstrated category-related patterns of response in this "visual" area, and in more ventral cortical regions in the fusiform gyrus, indicating that these patterns are not due to visual imagery and, furthermore, that visual experience is not necessary for category-related representations to develop in these cortices. These results demonstrate that the representation of objects in the ventral visual pathway is not simply a representation of visual images but, rather, is a representation of more abstract features of object form.

Abstract: Human visual recognition processes are remarkably robust and can function effectively even under highly degraded viewing conditions. Contextual information may play a critical role in such circumstances. Here, we provide neurophysiological evidence that contextual cues can elicit object-specific neural responses, which have hitherto been believed to be based on intrinsic cues alone. Specifically, we find that the "fusiform face area" (FFA) maintains its selectivity for faces without regard to whether the faces are defined intrinsically or contextually. This finding further elucidates the role of the FFA and reveals neural correlates of contextual processing in the service of robust object recognition.

Abstract: To what extent does neural activation in human visual cortex follow the temporal dynamics of the optical retinal stimulus? Specifically, to what extent does stimulus evoked neural activation persist after stimulus termination? In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the resulting temporal non-linearities across the entire constellation of human visual areas. Gray-scale images of animals, houses and faces were presented at two different presentation rates - 1 and 4 Hz - and the fMRI signal was analyzed in retinotopic and in high order occipito-temporal visual areas. In early visual areas and the motion sensitive area MT/V5, a fourfold increase in stimulus presentation rate evoked a twofold increase in signal amplitude. However, in high order visual areas, signal amplitude increased only by 25%. A control experiment ruled out the possibility that this difference was due to signal saturation ('ceiling') effects. A likely explanation for the stronger non-linearities in occipito-temporal cortex is a persistent neuronal activation that continues well after stimulus termination in the 1 Hz condition. These persistent activations might serve as a short term (iconic) memory mechanism for preserving a trace of the stimulus even in its absence and for future integration with temporally correlated stimuli. Two alternative models of persistence (inhibitory and excitatory) are proposed to explain the data.

Abstract: During apparent motion, spatially distinct items presented in alternation cause the perception of a visual stimulus smoothly traversing the intervening space where no physical stimulus exists. We used fMRI to determine whether the perceptual 'filling-in' that underlies this phenomenon has an early or late cortical locus. Subjects viewed a display comprised of concentric rings that elicited apparent motion (two concentric rings presented in alternation), flicker (the same rings presented simultaneously), or real motion. We independently localized the cortical regions corresponding to the path of apparent motion in early visual areas (V1, V2, VP, V3, V4v, V3A), as well as the human motion processing complex (MT+). Cortical activity in the path of apparent motion in early visual areas was similar in amplitude during both apparent motion and flicker. In contrast, cortical activity in MT+ was higher in amplitude during apparent motion than during flicker, but was lower in amplitude than during real motion. In addition, we observed overlap in the cortical loci of MT+ and the lateral occipital complex (LOC), a region involved in shape and object processing. This overlap suggests that these regions could directly interact and thereby support perceived object continuity during apparent motion.

Abstract: We investigated the neural basis of auditory object processing in the cerebral cortex by combining neural modeling and functional neuroimaging. We developed a large-scale, neurobiologically realistic network model of auditory pattern recognition that relates the neuronal dynamics of cortical auditory processing of frequency modulated (FM) sweeps to functional neuroimaging data of the type obtained using PET and fMRI. Areas included in the model extend from primary auditory to prefrontal cortex. The electrical activities of the neuronal units of the model were constrained to agree with data from the neurophysiological literature regarding the perception of FM sweeps. We also conducted an fMRI experiment using stimuli and tasks similar to those used in our simulations. The integrated synaptic activity of the neuronal units in each region of the model, convolved with a hemodynamic response function, was used as a correlate of the simulated fMRI activity, and generally agreed with the experimentally observed fMRI data in the brain areas corresponding to the regions of the model. Our results demonstrate that the model is capable of exhibiting the salient features of both electrophysiological neuronal activities and fMRI values that are in agreement with empirically observed data. These findings provide support for our hypotheses concerning how auditory objects are processed by primate neocortex.

Abstract: The modulation of repetition effects by the lag between first and second presentations of a visual object during a speeded semantic judgment task was examined using both scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (efMRI). Four levels of lag were used within a single session, from zero to one, to tens of intervening stimuli, and which allowed partial separation of the effects of interference from the effects of time. Reaction times (RTs) showed that the magnitude of repetition priming decreased as lag increased. The ERP data showed two distinct effects of repetition, one between 150 and 300 ms post stimulus and another between 400 and 600 ms. The magnitude of both effects, particularly the earlier one, decreased as lag increased. The fMRI data showed a decrease in the haemodynamic response associated with repetition in several inferior occipitotemporal regions, the magnitude of which also typically decreased as lag increased. In general, and contrary to expectations, lag appeared to have mainly quantitative effects on the three types of dependent variable: there was little evidence for qualitative differences in the neural correlates of repetition effects at different lags.

Abstract: We investigated dorsal visual stream involvement in the retrieval of a variety of visual attributes of common objects, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Seven subjects made binary decisions about the shape, color, and size of named objects during scanning. Bilateral parietal activity was significantly greater during retrieval of shape and size information than during retrieval of color information. Consistent with a domain-specific distributed model of semantic organization, the finding that dorsal stream activity is associated with size and shape retrieval, as compared with color retrieval, may indicate that both size and shape information are learned partly through dorsally mediated processes, such as visually guided grasping. These results demonstrate that both visual-processing streams (i.e., the ventral "what" pathway and the dorsal "where" pathway) are involved in the storage and/or retrieval of knowledge of object appearance but that, just as in vision, these two pathways may play different roles in conceptual processing.

Abstract: We performed meta-analyses on 60 neuroimaging (PET and fMRI) studies of working memory (WM), considering three types of storage material (spatial, verbal, and object), three types of executive function (continuous updating of WM, memory for temporal order, and manipulation of information in WM), and interactions between material and executive function. Analyses of material type showed the expected dorsal-ventral dissociation between spatial and nonspatial storage in the posterior cortex, but not in the frontal cortex. Some support was found for left frontal dominance in verbal WM, but only for tasks with low executive demand. Executive demand increased right lateralization in the frontal cortex for spatial WM. Tasks requiring executive processing generally produce more dorsal frontal activations than do storage-only tasks, but not all executive processes show this pattern. Brodmann's areas (BAs) 6, 8, and 9, in the superior frontal cortex, respond most when WM must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order must be maintained. Right BAs 10 and 47, in the ventral frontal cortex, respond more frequently with demand for manipulation (including dual-task requirements or mental operations). BA 7, in the posterior parietal cortex, is involved in all types of executive function. Finally, we consider a potential fourth executive function: selective attention to features of a stimulus to be stored in WM, which leads to increased probability of activating the medial prefrontal cortex (BA 32) in storage tasks.

Abstract: A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted during which seven subjects carried out naturalistic tactile object recognition (TOR) of real objects. Activation maps, conjunctions across subjects, were compared between tasks involving TOR of common real objects, palpation of "nonsense" objects, and rest. The tactile tasks involved similar motor and sensory stimulation, allowing higher tactile recognition processes to be isolated. Compared to nonsense object palpation, the most prominent activation evoked by TOR was in secondary somatosensory areas in the parietal operculum (SII) and insula, confirming a modality-specific path for TOR. Prominent activation was also present in medial and lateral secondary motor cortices, but not in primary motor areas, supporting the high level of sensory and motor integration characteristic of object recognition in the tactile modality. Activation in a lateral occipitotemporal area associated previously with visual object recognition may support cross-modal collateral activation. Finally, activation in medial temporal and prefrontal areas may reflect a common final pathway of modality-independent object recognition. This study suggests that TOR involves a complex network including parietal and insular somatosensory association cortices, as well as occipitotemporal visual areas, prefrontal, and medial temporal supramodal areas, and medial and lateral secondary motor cortices. It confirms the involvement of somatosensory association areas in the recognition component of TOR, and the existence of a ventrolateral somatosensory pathway for TOR in intact subjects. It challenges the results of previous studies that emphasize the role of visual cortex rather than somatosensory association cortices in higher-level somatosensory cognition.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography was used to investigate whether the motor-iconic basis of certain forms in American Sign Language (ASL) partially alters the neural systems engaged during lexical retrieval. Most ASL nouns denoting tools and ASL verbs referring to tool-based actions are produced with a handshape representing the human hand holding a tool and with an iconic movement depicting canonical tool use, whereas the visual iconicity of animal signs is more idiosyncratic and inconsistent across signs. We investigated whether the motor-iconic relation between a sign and its referent alters the neural substrate for lexical retrieval in ASL. Ten deaf native ASL signers viewed photographs of tools/utensils or of actions performed with or without an implement and were asked to overtly produce the ASL sign for each object or action. The control task required subjects to judge the orientation of unknown faces. Compared to the control task, naming tools engaged left inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral parietal lobe, and posterior inferotemporal cortex. Naming actions performed with or without a tool engaged left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral parietal lobe, and posterior middle temporal gyrus at the temporo-occipital junction (area MT). When motor-iconic verbs were compared with non-iconic verbs, no differences in neural activation were found. Overall, the results indicate that even when the form of a sign is indistinguishable from a pantomimic gesture, the neural systems underlying its production mirror those engaged when hearing speakers name tools or tool-based actions with speech.

Abstract: Cohen and Dehaene et al. proposed that the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) in the left midfusiform gyrus, contrary to its name, is limited to the extraction of an abstract letter string and not involved in proper visual word recognition. We examined this prelexical function of the VWFA by a parametric block design with five levels of written word frequency. The lowest level was represented by pseudowords and the highest level by words of very high frequency. Contrary to the assumed prelexical function of the VWFA, increasing frequency was associated with decreasing brain activation in a large posterior cluster of the left hemisphere including middle and posterior fusiform regions. The same negative relation between frequency and activation was found in several left frontal clusters. The relation of increasing frequency and decreasing activation in occipitotemporal regions corresponds to a similar relation in the same brain regions found by studies which experimentally manipulated object or face familiarity. This convergence suggests that fusiform regions are specialized for extracting and storing abstract patterns when processing visual objects and these patterns serve as recognition units in subsequent encounters with the same objects.

Abstract: Object completion is an inherent property of visual recognition in which objects can be accurately perceived in the presence of substantial obstructions. We have previously shown [Cereb. Cortex 12 (2002) 163] that high-order human object areas are driven partially by local object fragments and partially by global completion effects. Here we explored, through a backward masking paradigm, whether the balance of local and global processing is time dependent, that is, to what extent completion effects evolve at a different time compared to local image representations. In two separate experiments, subjects were presented with three types of images: (a) unobstructed line drawings of animal shapes ("whole"), (b) the same shapes obstructed by a set of parallel stripes ("grid"), and (c) a scrambled version of b in which the stripe position was shifted horizontally, disrupting the relative position of image regions but maintaining the local feature distribution ("scrambled"). Images were presented either for 60 or 250 ms followed by a mask. Both behavioral and fMRI findings from high-order occipitotemporal object areas showed consistently that object selectivity emerges at the same time as the local feature representation. Thus, object completion effects were evident at the same relative magnitude (LO: 0.5 +/- 0.3 and 0.58 +/- 0.04; pFs: 0.62 +/- 0.3 and 0.6 +/- 0.04; 60 and 250 ms, respectively) even at the short presentation durations when overall object activation was greatly reduced.

Abstract: Physiological studies of auditory perception have not yet clearly distinguished sensory from decision processes. In this experiment, human participants identified speech sounds masked by varying levels of noise while blood oxygenation signals in the brain were recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Accuracy and response time were used to characterize the behavior of sensory and decision components of this perceptual system. Oxygenation signals in a cortical subregion just anterior and lateral to primary auditory cortex predicted accuracy of sound identification, whereas signals in an inferior frontal region predicted response time. Our findings provide neurophysiological evidence for a functional distinction between sensory and decision mechanisms underlying auditory object identification. The present results also indicate a link between inferior frontal lobe activation and response-selection processes during auditory perception tasks.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the detection of multiple small brain lesions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. A model based on the marked point process framework is designed to detect Virchow-Robin spaces (VRSs). These tubular shaped spaces are due to retraction of the brain parenchyma from its supplying arteries. VRS are described by simple geometrical objects that are introduced as small tubular structures. Their radiometric properties are embedded in a data term. A prior model includes interactions describing the clustering property of VRS. A Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (RJMCMC) optimizes the proposed model, obtained by multiplying the prior and the data model. Example results are shown on T1-weighted MRI datasets of elderly subjects.

Abstract: Though commonly held that multisensory experiences enrich our memories and that memories influence ongoing sensory processes, their neural mechanisms remain unresolved. Here, electrical neuroimaging shows that auditory-visual multisensory experiences alter subsequent processing of unisensory visual stimuli during the same block of trials at early stages poststimulus onset and within visual object recognition areas. We show this with a stepwise analysis of scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) that statistically tested (1) ERP morphology and amplitude, (2) global electric field power, (3) topographic stability of and changes in the electric field configuration, and (4) intracranial distributed linear source estimations. Subjects performed a continuous recognition task, discriminating repeated vs. initial image presentations. Corresponding, but task-irrelevant, sounds accompanied half of the initial presentations during a given block of trials. On repeated presentations within a block of trials, only images appeared, yielding two situations-the image's prior presentation was only visual or with a sound. Image repetitions that had been accompanied by sounds yielded improved memory performance accuracy (old or new discrimination) and were differentiated as early as approximately 60-136 ms from images that had not been accompanied by sounds through generator changes in areas of the right lateral-occipital complex (LOC). It thus appears that unisensory percepts trigger multisensory representations associated with them. The collective data support the hypothesis that perceptual or memory traces for multisensory auditory-visual events involve a distinct cortical network that is rapidly activated by subsequent repetition of just the unisensory visual component.

Abstract: The way in which information about objects is represented in visual cortex remains controversial. One model of human object recognition poses that information is processed in modules, highly specialised for different categories of objects; an opposing model appeals to a distributed representation across a large network of visual areas. We addressed this debate by monitoring activity in face- and object-selective areas while human subjects viewed ambiguous face stimuli (Mooney faces). The measured neural response in the face-selective region of the fusiform gyrus was greater when subjects reported seeing a face than when they perceived the image as a collection of blobs. In contrast, there was no difference in magnetic resonance response between face and no-face perceived events in either the face-selective voxels of the superior temporal sulcus or the object-selective voxels of the parahippocampal gyrus and lateral occipital complex. These results challenge the concept that neural representation of faces is distributed and overlapping and suggest that the fusiform gyrus is tightly linked to the awareness of faces.

Abstract: Associative visual agnosia is classically defined as normal visual perception stripped of its meaning [Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten 21 (1890) 22/English translation: Cognitive Neuropsychol. 5 (1988) 155]: these patients cannot access to their stored visual memories to categorize the objects nonetheless perceived correctly. However, according to an influential theory of visual agnosia [Farah, Visual Agnosia: Disorders of Object Recognition and What They Tell Us about Normal Vision, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1990], visual associative agnosics necessarily present perceptual deficits that are the cause of their impairment at object recognition Here we report a detailed investigation of a patient with bilateral occipito-temporal lesions strongly impaired at object and face recognition. NS presents normal drawing copy, and normal performance at object and face matching tasks as used in classical neuropsychological tests. However, when tested with several computer tasks using carefully controlled visual stimuli and taking both his accuracy rate and response times into account, NS was found to have abnormal performances at high-level visual processing of objects and faces. Albeit presenting a different pattern of deficits than previously described in integrative agnosic patients such as HJA and LH, his deficits were characterized by an inability to integrate individual parts into a whole percept, as suggested by his failure at processing structurally impossible three-dimensional (3D) objects, an absence of face inversion effects and an advantage at detecting and matching single parts. Taken together, these observations question the idea of separate visual representations for object/face perception and object/face knowledge derived from investigations of visual associative (prosop)agnosia, and they raise some methodological issues in the analysis of single-case studies of (prosop)agnosic patients.

Abstract: In many medical imaging applications, due to the limited field of view of imaging devices, acquired images often include only a part of a structure. In such situations, it is impossible to guarantee that the images will contain exactly the same physical extent of the structure at different scans, which leads to difficulties in registration and in many other tasks, such as the analysis of the morphology, architecture, and kinematics of the structures. To facilitate such analysis, we developed a general method, referred to as iso-shaping, that generates structures of the same shape from segmented image sequences. The basis for this method is to automatically find a set of key points, called shape centers, in the segmented partial anatomic structure such that these points are present in all images and that they represent the same physical location in the object, and then trim the structure using these points as reference. The application area considered here is the analysis of the morphology, architecture, and kinematics of the joints of the foot from magnetic resonance images acquired at different joint positions and load conditions. The accuracy of the method is analyzed by utilizing ten data sets for iso-shaping the tibia and the fibula via four evaluative experiments. The analysis indicates that iso-shaping produces results as predicted by the theoretical framework.

Abstract: We present a case of a 64-year-old, right-handed female with a metastatic breast cancer lesion involving the left posterior inferior temporal lobe causing complete loss of the ability to recognize visually common objects and words. After her symptoms resolved on corticosteroid therapy, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mapping demonstrated strong left-hemispheric dominance for word recognition and right-hemispheric dominance for object recognition. The case illustrates the relationships among ventral occipito-temporal cortical activation, lesion localization, and lesion-induced deficits of higher visual function. The relationship between hemispheric dominance determined by fMRI and risk of postoperative deficit depends on the specific visual function of interest.

Abstract: We describe a model of invariant visual object recognition in the brain that incorporates feedback biasing effects of top-down attentional mechanisms on a hierarchically organized set of visual cortical areas with convergent forward connectivity, reciprocal feedback connections, and local intra-area competition. The model displays space-based and object-based covert visual search by using attentional top-down feedback from either the posterior parietal or the inferior temporal cortex (IT) modules, and interactions between the two processing streams occurring in V1 and V2. The model explains the gradually increasing magnitude of the attentional modulation that is found in fMRI experiments from earlier visual areas (V1, V2) to higher ventral stream visual areas (V4, IT); how the effective size of the receptive fields of IT neurons becomes smaller in natural cluttered scenes; and makes predictions about interactions between stimuli in their receptive fields.

Abstract: This study used event-related fMRI to explore the neural basis of semantic involvement when performing a visually guided grasping movement. Three types of object images were presented in random order: familiar objects with handles (FH+) familiar objects without handles (FH-) and geometrical objects with a handle-like part (GH+). Subjects were then instructed to configure an appropriate hand shape for grasping the object. Common activations were found for all event types when contrasted with baseline. Activation of the anterior part of the rostral cingulate motor area was detected for only the FH+ condition and these results imply that the appropriate selection of multiple motor schemata took place in this region.

Abstract: In this study, event-related fMRI was used to examine whether the resolution of interference arising from two different information contents activates the same or different neuronal circuitries. In addition, we examined the extent to which these inhibitory control mechanisms are modulated by individual differences in working memory capacity. Two groups of participants with high and low working memory capacity [high span (HS) and low span (LS) participants, respectively] performed two versions of an item recognition task with familiar letters and abstract objects as stimulus materials. Interference costs were examined by means of the recent negative probe technique with otherwise identical testing conditions across both tasks. While the behavioral interference costs were of similar magnitude in both tasks, the underlying brain activation pattern differed between tasks: The object task interference-effects (higher activation in interference trials than in control trials) were restricted to the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Interference effects for familiar letters were obtained in the anterior IPS, the left postero-ventral and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as the precuneus. As the letters were more discernible than the objects, the results suggest that the critical feature for PFC and precuneus involvement in interference resolution is the saliency of stimulus-response mappings. The interference effects in the letter task were modulated by working memory capacity: LS participants showed enhanced activation for interference trials only, whereas for HS participants, who showed better performance and also lower interference costs in the letter task, the above-mentioned neuronal circuitry was activated for interference and control trials, thereby attenuating the interference effects. The latter results support the view that HS individuals allocate more attentional resources for the maintenance of task goals in the face of interfering information from preceding trials with familiar stimulus materials.

Abstract: Persisting anosognosia after acute lesions is relatively rare, and no case studies to date have reported functional scanning investigation of this disorder. This is a case report of an 85-year-old right-handed Scottish woman, EN, who showed persistent anosognosia for hemiplegia following a haemorrhagic stroke. Extensive damage in the right hemisphere caused left upper and lower limb flaccid hemiplegia and severe left-sided neglect. Lack of awareness for her deficits was still present 2 years after the stroke, when neurological, neuropsychological, and SPECT examinations were performed. Testing revealed severe left unilateral neglect and poor performance on verbal fluency tasks. EN had age normal memory performance, and her object recognition and praxic abilities were preserved. She showed no global reasoning or language problems apart from her abnormal beliefs. EN believed that she was able to walk and carry out several activities, in a context of other disorders of belief. SPECT scan showed marked hypoperfusion in the right parietotemporal cortex and this extended to the associative cortex in the right frontal regions. The persistence of anosognosia in this patient cannot be explained by memory impairments or global cognitive decline. A possible account might be that alteration in awareness was maintained by contingent right frontal and/or parietal dysfunction causing a suspension or change in the ability to monitor and check the 'real' and especially to assess the veracity of mental contents.

Abstract: A network of fronto-parietal cortical areas is known to be involved in the control of visual attention, but the representational scope and specific function of these areas remains unclear. Recent neuroimaging evidence has revealed the existence of both transient (attention-shift) and sustained (attention-maintenance) mechanisms of space-based and object-based attentional control. Here we investigate the neural mechanisms of feature-based attentional control in human cortex using rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects viewed an aperture containing moving dots in which dot color and direction of motion changed once per second. At any given moment, observers attended to either motion or color. Two of six motion directions and two of six colors embedded in the stimulus stream cued subjects either to shift attention from the currently attended to the unattended feature or to maintain attention on the currently attended feature. Attentional modulation of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal was observed in early visual areas that are selective for motion and color. More importantly, both transient and sustained BOLD activity patterns were observed in different fronto-parietal cortical areas during shifts of attention. We suggest these differing temporal profiles reflect complementary roles in the control of attention to perceptual features.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether autistic subjects show a different pattern of neural activity than healthy individuals during processing of faces and complex patterns. METHODS: Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes accompanying visual processing of faces and complex patterns were analyzed in an autistic group (n = 7; 25.3 [6.9] years) and a control group (n = 7; 27.7 [7.8] years). RESULTS: Compared with unaffected subjects, autistic subjects demonstrated lower BOLD signals in the fusiform gyrus, most prominently during face processing, and higher signals in the more object-related medial occipital gyrus. Further signal increases in autistic subjects vs controls were found in regions highly important for visual search: the superior parietal lobule and the medial frontal gyrus, where the frontal eye fields are located. CONCLUSIONS: The cortical activation pattern during face processing indicates deficits in the face-specific regions, with higher activations in regions involved in visual search. These findings reflect different strategies for visual processing, supporting models that propose a predisposition to local rather than global modes of information processing in autism.

Abstract: OBJECT: In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the cerebral functions represented in the angular gyrus and to spare them during surgery, the authors studied patients with brain tumors located close to the angular gyrus and mapped cortical sites by using electrostimulation. METHODS: Before undergoing tumor removal, six right-handed patients (five with left and one with right hemisphere tumors) were studied using cortical mapping with the aid of calculating, writing, finger-recognition, and color-naming tasks in addition to standard reading and object-naming tasks (for a total of 36 brain mapping studies). Strict conditions of functional site validation were applied to include only those cortical sites that produced repetitive interferences in the function tested. Preoperatively, four of the patients exhibited discrete symptoms related to Gerstmann syndrome while performing very specific tasks, whereas the other two patients presented with no symptoms of the syndrome. No patient had significant language or apraxic deficits. Distinct or shared cortical sites producing interferences in calculating, finger recognition, and writing were repeatedly found in the angular gyrus. Object- or color-naming sites and reading-interference sites were also found in or close to the angular gyrus; although frequently demonstrated, these latter results were variable and unpredictable in the group of patients studied. Finger agnosia and acalculia sites were also found elsewhere, such as in the supramarginal gyrus or close to the intraparietal sulcus. Mechanisms involved in acalculia, agraphia, or finger agnosia (either complete interferences or hesitations) during stimulation were various, from an aphasia-like form (for instance, the patient did not understand the numbers or words given for calculating or writing tasks) to an apparently pure interference in the function tested (patients understood the numbers, but were unable to perform a simple addition). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome can be found during direct brain mapping in the angular gyrus region. In this series of patients, sites producing interferences in writing, calculating, and finger recognition were demonstrated in the angular gyrus, which may or may not have been associated with object-naming, color-naming, or reading sites.

Abstract: The fusiform gyrus is important for face and object recognition, is abnormal in schizophrenia, but has not been studied in schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Thin-slice MR images showed no differences, either in right, left or total fusiform gyri volumes, between subjects with SPD (N=21) and normal controls (N=19). However, there was a correlation between severity of illusions and magical thinking suffered by the SPD subjects and smaller right fusiform gyrus volumes. This suggests that future studies may be useful in determining the functional competence of this gyrus in SPD.

Abstract: D.F., a patient with severe visual form agnosia, has been the subject of extensive research during the past decade. The fact that she could process visual input accurately for the purposes of guiding action despite being unable to perform visual discriminations on the same visual input inspired a novel interpretation of the functions of the two main cortical visual pathways or 'streams'. Within this theoretical context, the authors proposed that D.F. had suffered severe bilateral damage to her occipitotemporal visual system (the 'ventral stream'), while retaining the use of her occipitoparietal visual system (the 'dorsal stream'). The present paper reports a direct test of this idea, which was initially derived from purely behavioural data, before the advent of modern functional neuroimaging. We used functional MRI to examine activation in her ventral and dorsal streams during object recognition and object-directed grasping tasks. We found that D.F. showed no difference in activation when presented with line drawings of common objects compared with scrambled line drawings in the lateral occipital cortex (LO) of the ventral stream, an area that responded differentially to these stimuli in healthy individuals. Moreover, high-resolution anatomical MRI showed that her lesion corresponded bilaterally with the location of LO in healthy participants. The lack of activation with line drawings in D.F. mirrors her poor performance in identifying the objects depicted in the drawings. With coloured and greyscale pictures, stimuli that she can identify more often, D.F. did show some ventral-stream activation. These activations were, however, more widely distributed than those seen in control participants and did not include LO. In contrast to the absent or abnormal activation observed during these perceptual tasks, D.F. showed robust activation in the expected dorsal stream regions during object grasping, despite considerable atrophy in some regions of the parietal lobes. In particular, an area in the anterior intraparietal sulcus was activated more for grasping an object than for just reaching to that object, for both D.F. and controls. In conclusion, we have been able to confirm directly that D.F.'s visual form agnosia is associated with extensive damage to the ventral stream, and that her spared visuomotor skills are associated with visual processing in the dorsal stream.

Abstract: Object perception has been a subject of extensive fMRI studies in recent years. Yet the nature of the cortical representation of objects in the human brain remains controversial. Analyses of fMRI data have traditionally focused on the activation of individual voxels associated with presentation of various stimuli. The current analysis approaches functional imaging data as collective information about the stimulus. Linking activity in the brain to a stimulus is treated as a pattern-classification problem. Linear discriminant analysis was used to reanalyze a set of data originally published by Ishai et al. (2000), available from the fMRIDC (accession no. 2-2000-1113D). Results of the new analysis reveal that patterns of activity that distinguish one category of objects from other categories are largely independent of one another, both in terms of the activity and spatial overlap. The information used to detect objects from phase-scrambled control stimuli is not essential in distinguishing one object category from another. Furthermore, performing an object-matching task during the scan significantly improved the ability to predict objects from controls, but had minimal effect on object classification, suggesting that the task-based attentional benefit was non-specific to object categories.

Abstract: Although both reaching and grasping require transporting the hand to the object location, only grasping also requires processing of object shape, size and orientation to preshape the hand. Behavioural and neuropsychological evidence suggests that the object processing required for grasping relies on different neural substrates from those mediating object recognition. Specifically, whereas object recognition is believed to rely on structures in the ventral (occipitotemporal) stream, object grasping appears to rely on structures in the dorsal (occipitoparietal) stream. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether grasping (compared to reaching) produced activation in dorsal areas, ventral areas, or both. We found greater activity for grasping than reaching in several regions, including anterior intraparietal (AIP) cortex. We also performed a standard object perception localizer (comparing intact vs. scrambled 2D object images) in the same subjects to identify the lateral occipital complex (LOC), a ventral stream area believed to play a critical role in object recognition. Although LOC was activated by the objects presented on both grasping and reaching trials, there was no greater activity for grasping compared to reaching. These results suggest that dorsal areas, including AIP, but not ventral areas such as LOC, play a fundamental role in computing object properties during grasping.

Abstract: Neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that the production of nouns and verbs can be dissociated in aphasia. These reports have been taken as evidence for separate representations of nouns and verbs in the human brain. We used whole-head magnetoencephalography to record cortical dynamics of action and object naming in 10 healthy adults and in 1 anomic patient with superior naming of verbs compared with nouns due to a left posterior parietal lesion. A single set of 100 line drawings was used for both action and object naming. In normal subjects, the activation sequences in action and object naming were essentially identical, advancing from the occipital to posterior temporoparietal and further to the left frontal cortex, without consistent involvement of the classical left inferior frontal (Broca) and temporal (Wernicke) language areas. In the anomic patient, pronounced differences between action and object naming emerged in the left hemisphere. The activation sequence was disrupted at the level of the damaged parietal cortex and did not reach the left frontal cortex even in the relatively easier action naming. The more severely impaired object naming was associated with exceptionally strong and early activation of the left inferior frontal cortex (Broca) and subsequent pronounced activation of the left middle temporal cortex, silent in action naming. Verb and noun retrieval thus utilized a spatiotemporally similar neuronal network in healthy individuals. A clear dissociation in cortical correlates of verb and noun retrieval only became evident in our anomic patient, in whom damage to the language network has resulted in disproportionately worse performance in object than action naming.

Abstract: Parallel processing affords the brain many advantages, but processing multiple bits of information simultaneously presents formidable challenges. For example, while one is listening to a speaker at a noisy social gathering, processing irrelevant conversations may lead to the activation of irrelevant perceptual, semantic, and response representations that conflict with those evoked by the speaker. In these situations, specialized brain systems may be recruited to detect and resolve conflict before it leads to incorrect perception and/or behavior. Consistent with this view, recent findings indicate that dorsal/caudal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), on the medial walls of the frontal lobes, detects conflict between competing motor responses primed by relevant versus irrelevant stimuli. Here, we used a cued global/local selective attention task to investigate whether the dACC plays a general role in conflict detection that includes monitoring for conflicting perceptual or semantic representations. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that the dACC was activated by response conflict in both the global and the local task, consistent with results from prior studies. However, dACC was also activated by perceptual and semantic conflict arising from global distracters during the local task. The results from the local task have implications for recent theories of attentional control in which the dACC's contribution to conflict monitoring is limited to response stages of processing, as well as for our understanding of clinical disorders in which disruptions of attention are associated with dACC dysfunction.

Abstract: In this work a new statistic deformable model for 3D segmentation of anatomical organs in medical images is proposed. A statistic discriminant snake performs a supervised learning of the object boundary in an image slice to segment the next slice of the image sequence. Each part of the object boundary is projected in a feature space generated by a bank of Gaussian filters. Then, clusters corresponding to different boundary pieces are constructed by means of linear discriminant analysis. Finally, a parametric classifier is generated from each contour in the image slice and embodied into the snake energy-minimization process to guide the snake deformation in the next image slice. The discriminant snake selects and classifies image features by the parametric classifier and deforms to minimize the dissimilarity between the learned and found image features. The new approach is of particular interest for segmenting 3D images with anisotropic spatial resolution, and for tracking temporal image sequences. In particular, several anatomical organs from different imaging modalities are segmented and the results compared to expert tracings.

Abstract: Knowledge about the biological variability of anatomical objects is essential for statistical shape analysis and discrimination between healthy and pathological structures. This paper describes a novel approach that incorporates the variability of an object population into the generation of a characteristic 3D shape model. The proposed shape representation is a coarse-scale sampled medial description derived from a fine-scale spherical harmonics (SPHARM) boundary description. This medial description is composed of a net of medial samples (m-rep) with fixed graph properties. The medial model is computed automatically from a predefined shape space using pruned 3D Voronoi skeletons. A new method determines the stable medial branching topology from the shape space. An intrinsic coordinate system and an implicit correspondence between shapes is defined on the medial manifold. Several studies of biological structures clearly demonstrate that the novel representation has the promise to describe shape changes in a natural and intuitive way. A new medial shape similarity study of group differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in lateral ventricle shape demonstrates the meaningful and powerful representation of local and global form.

Abstract: We report the performance of a herpes simplex encephalitis patient, EA, who shows a dissociation between poor performance for living things and spared performance for sensory quality categories, when appropriate measures are taken to control for baseline differences among categories in task difficulty and when we eliminate the contribution of visual processing deficits in the recognition of objects. This pattern of performance is problematic for theories of category-specific deficits that are based on the assumption that these deficits reflect selective damage to modality-specific semantic subsystems but is consistent with domain-specific accounts and theories based on the assumption that the structure of conceptual knowledge reflects the correlational structure among object properties.

Abstract: How are different object categories organized by the visual system? Current evidence indicates that monkeys and humans process object categories in fundamentally different ways. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that humans have a ventral temporal face area, but such evidence is lacking in macaques. Instead, face-responsive neurons in macaques seem to be scattered throughout temporal cortex, with some relative concentration in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here, using fMRI in alert fixating macaque monkeys and humans, we found that macaques do have discrete face-selective patches, similar in relative size and number to face patches in humans. The face patches were embedded within a large swath of object-selective cortex extending from V4 to rostral TE. This large region responded better to pictures of intact objects compared to scrambled objects, with different object categories eliciting different patterns of activity, as in the human. Overall, our results suggest that humans and macaques share a similar brain architecture for visual object processing.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several procedures for testing language lateralization and memory function exist during the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT). The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) gives the opportunity to assess the validity of some of these procedures, or at least to inspect the neuronal correlates. A comprehensive fMRI protocol was tested, aimed at addressing aspects of lateralization of language, as well as testing memory in relation to activation of mesiotemporal regions. Here we report observations with possible consequences for the current IAT procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol consisted of three language tasks (overt naming, semantic decision and silent word generation) and two memory tasks (encoding and retrieving visual scenes). The paradigms used a block-related procedure in nine right-handed normal volunteers. During the procedure dynamic weighted full brain images were acquired which are sensitive to the blood oxygenation activation effect. RESULTS: Encoding showed symmetrical bilateral activation in the mesiotemporal regions, specifically the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. With a retrieval task activation of the mesiotemporal areas was restricted to the posterior hippocampal area. Overt object naming showed results, similar to encoding tasks with bilateral activation of hippocampal areas. Silent word generation showed much stronger ability to lateralize than the other two language-related tasks and especially object naming. CONCLUSION: Activation revealed by fMRI activation shows that IAT procedures, using active semantic language processing or comprehensive procedures with multiple language tasks have the highest guarantee for individual activation lateralization. Simple object naming does not guarantee a lateralized language fMRI activation pattern. Of the different memory procedures during IAT, the procedures (Interview and the Montreal) demanding encoding processing will be related to larger areas of bilateral hippocampal activation than procedures (Seattle) exclusively requiring retrieval. Moreover, tasks using recognition of previously presented language items (naming objects) are equally effective for assessing hippocampal activation compared with presenting separate memory items.

Abstract: We used human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether the human lateral occipital complex (LOC), an area known to be involved in the analysis of visual shape, represents the perceived 3-D shape of objects or simply their 2-D contours. We employed an fMRI adaptation paradigm, in which repeated presentation of a stimulus results in decreased responses compared to responses to different stimuli. We found adaptation in the LOC for images of objects with the same perceived 3-D shape structure but different 2-D contours that resulted from small rotations of the objects in the frontal plane or in depth. However, no adaptation was observed in the LOC for images of objects that had the same 2-D contours but differed in their perceived 3-D shape; namely, 2-D silhouettes versus 3-D shaded images of objects, or convex versus concave objects. Differences in the fMRI adaptation responses across subregions in the LOC suggest that different neural populations in the LOC may mediate different mechanisms for the processing of object features.

Abstract: Previous functional imaging studies have shown that facilitated processing of a visual object on repeated, relative to initial, presentation (i.e., repetition priming) is associated with reductions in neural activity in multiple regions, including fusiform/lateral occipital cortex. Moreover, activity reductions have been found, at diminished levels, when a different exemplar of an object is presented on repetition. In one previous study, the magnitude of diminished priming across exemplars was greater in the right relative to the left fusiform, suggesting greater exemplar specificity in the right. Another previous study, however, observed fusiform lateralization modulated by object viewpoint, but not object exemplar. The present fMRI study sought to determine whether the result of differential fusiform responses for perceptually different exemplars could be replicated. Furthermore, the role of the left fusiform cortex in object recognition was investigated via the inclusion of a lexical/semantic manipulation. Right fusiform cortex showed a significantly greater effect of exemplar change than left fusiform, replicating the previous result of exemplar-specific fusiform lateralization. Right fusiform and lateral occipital cortex were not differentially engaged by the lexical/semantic manipulation, suggesting that their role in visual object recognition is predominantly in the visual discrimination of specific objects. Activation in left fusiform cortex, but not left lateral occipital cortex, was modulated by both exemplar change and lexical/semantic manipulation, with further analysis suggesting a posterior-to-anterior progression between regions involved in processing visuoperceptual and lexical/semantic information about objects. The results are consistent with the view that the right fusiform plays a greater role in processing specific visual form information about objects, whereas the left fusiform is also involved in lexical/semantic processing.

Abstract: Category-specific naming deficits and differential brain activation patterns have been reported in patients naming living as opposed to nonliving objects. The authors report on a case in which they used preoperative functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging, intraoperative electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM), and postoperative neuropsychological testing to map language function. Using the latter two modalities, the authors identified a specific locus for category-specific naming in the posterior inferior temporal lobe, presumably a part of the basal temporal language area. Preoperative fMR imaging findings revealed the presence of a language area in the inferior temporal lobe; intraoperative ESM results indicated that this cortical area may be category specific for living objects; and after resection of the area, the results of postoperative neuropsychological testing confirmed that the patient made significantly more errors while naming living objects compared with nonliving ones (p < 0.001), independent of the effects of word frequency and with an intact system of object recognition and comprehension. These authors are the first to identify a specific and well-localized area of category-specific naming in the inferior temporal lobe and to demonstrate congruence of intraoperative and postoperative category-specific naming deficits. They also emphasize the roles of preoperative and intraoperative testing in predicting clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Human occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) is critically involved in object recognition, but the functional organization of this brain region is controversial. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal changes were recorded in humans during an animal-matching task that parametrically varied degree of structural (i.e., shape) similarity among the items. fMRI signal in the mid- to anterior-fusiform gyrus increased as animals overlapped more in terms of structure and as reaction time increased. In contrast, relatively more posterior aspects of the fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital cortex showed greater fMRI signal when the animals overlapped less in terms of structure. A similar organization emerged when three-dimensional geometric shapes were matched, indicating that OTC is differentially tuned to varying degrees of overlap in object structure, regardless of taxonomic category. We discuss how the present findings fit in with current functional neuroanatomical approaches to object recognition.

Abstract: How are the bits and pieces of retinal information assembled and integrated to form the coherent objects that we see? One long-established principle is that elements that move as a group are linked together. For instance a fragmented line-drawing of an object, placed on a background of randomly distributed short lines, can be impossible to see. But if the object moves relative to the background, its shape is instantly recognized. Even after the motion stops, the percept of the object persists briefly before it fades into the background of random lines. Where in the brain does the percept of the object persist? Using functional brain imaging, we found that such moving line-drawings activated both motion-sensitive areas (medial temporal complex, MT+) and object-sensitive areas (lateral occipital complex, LOC). However, after the motion stopped only the LOC maintained its activity while the percept endured. Evidently a percept assembled by motion-sensitive areas like MT+ can be stored, at least briefly, in the LOC.

Abstract: Recently we reported that the topographic organization of visual field eccentricity in human visual cortex extends into high-order, ventral occipitotemporal (VOT) cortex. Within this cortex, regions that respond preferentially to faces and buildings have specific eccentricity biases, suggesting that this category-eccentricity association may reflect differential needs of recognition processes. However, it is still not clear to what extent this center/periphery differentiation within high-order occipitotemporal cortex depends on immediate, moment-to-moment, task demands. Previous attention studies were confined either to exploring the visual field topography (spatial attention) or to object identity (object-based attention). Here, we combined the investigation of these two different attentional mechanisms in the same study. We found that the main source of attentional modulation in occipitotemporal cortex was object-based attention. Shifting attention to different object categories (buildings, faces, and arrows) substantially modulated the object-related activations. The differential activation to each object category in occipitotemporal object areas was maintained, albeit at a reduced level, even when attention was focused on different spatial locations. A slight eccentricity-related attentional differentiation was observed in the more dorsal lateral occipital region, but not in the VOT cortex. These results argue against the possibility that the source of the eccentricity differentiation in VOT cortex is due solely to moment-to-moment shifts in spatial attention mechanism and supports the notion that the eccentricity-biased maps found in this region are due to built-in shape selectivity established over long-term processes.

Abstract: Traditional (univariate) analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data relies exclusively on the information contained in the time course of individual voxels. Multivariate analyses can take advantage of the information contained in activity patterns across space, from multiple voxels. Such analyses have the potential to greatly expand the amount of information extracted from fMRI data sets. In the present study, multivariate statistical pattern recognition methods, including linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines, were used to classify patterns of fMRI activation evoked by the visual presentation of various categories of objects. Classifiers were trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest during a subset of trials for each subject individually. Classification of subsequently collected fMRI data was attempted according to the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples. Classification was done using only small amounts of data (20 s worth) at a time, so such a technique could, in principle, be used to extract information about a subject's percept on a near real-time basis. Classifiers trained on data acquired during one session were equally accurate in classifying data collected within the same session and across sessions separated by more than a week, in the same subject. Although the highest classification accuracies were obtained using patterns of activity including lower visual areas as input, classification accuracies well above chance were achieved using regions of interest restricted to higher-order object-selective visual areas. In contrast to typical fMRI data analysis, in which hours of data across many subjects are averaged to reveal slight differences in activation, the use of pattern recognition methods allows a subtle 10-way discrimination to be performed on an essentially trial-by-trial basis within individuals, demonstrating that fMRI data contain far more information than is typically appreciated.

Abstract: A method is presented for tracking object boundaries in sequential images using an active contour model, based on fuzzy reasoning rule-based control. Evolution of contour segments is controlled by separate processes based on whether the segment is judged to be inside, outside, or near the boundary of the object, leading to robust boundary detection.

Abstract: The present study determined the extent to which object and letter recognition recruit similar or dissociated neural resources. Participants passively viewed and silently named line drawings of objects, single letters, and visual noise patterns and centrally fixated an asterisk. We used whole-brain functional MRI and a very conservative approach to hypothesis testing that distinguished among brain regions that were selectively activated by different experimental conditions and those that were conjointly activated. The left fusiform gyrus (BA 19 & 37) and left inferior frontal cortex BA(44/6) showed a greater degree of conjoined activation for objects and letters than selective activation for either category, whereas left inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) and the left insula showed a strong letter-selective response. Equal recruitment of left fusiform and inferior frontal regions by objects and letters reflects similar demands on cognitive processing by these two categories and argues against category-specific modules in these regions. However, cortical systems for object and letter processing are not completely shared given the exclusive activation of left inferior parietal cortex by letters.

Abstract: Active shape models (ASMs) are often limited by the inability of relatively few eigenvectors to capture the full range of biological shape variability. This paper presents a method that overcomes this limitation, by using a hierarchical formulation of active shape models, using the wavelet transform. The statistical properties of the wavelet transform of a deformable contour are analyzed via principal component analysis, and used as priors in the contour's deformation. Some of these priors reflect relatively global shape characteristics of the object boundaries, whereas, some of them capture local and high-frequency shape characteristics and, thus, serve as local smoothness constraints. This formulation achieves two objectives. First, it is robust when only a limited number of training samples is available. Second, by using local statistics as smoothness constraints, it eliminates the need for adopting ad hoc physical models, such as elasticity or other smoothness models, which do not necessarily reflect true biological variability. Examples on magnetic resonance images of the corpus callosum and hand contours demonstrate that good and fully automated segmentations can be achieved, even with as few as five training samples.

Abstract: Humans can recognize an object within a fraction of a second, even if there are no clues about what kind of object it might be. Recent findings have identified functional properties of extrastriate regions in the ventral visual pathway that are involved in the representation and perception of objects and faces. The functional properties of these regions, and the correlation between the activation of these regions and visual recognition, indicate that the lateral and ventral occipito-temporal areas are important in perceiving and recognizing objects and faces.

Abstract: Development of the accurate and reproducible parcellation of the human brain can be used to resolve the complex structure-functional relationships in the brain. We propose a modified parcellation method that provides the reliable and reproducible regions of interest using successive fuzzy c-means (sFCM) and boundary-detection algorithm. This method displays simultaneously both original brain image for identifying the sulcal landmarks and its tissue-classified image for referring to patterns of sulci. The whole cerebral region is extracted by the semiautomated region growing method and then classified to gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid by sFCM. Referred to the other previous researches, the volume ratio of gray matter to white matter was shown to find that the efficiency of classification was improved (conventional FCM: 0.80 +/- 0.12 vs. sFCM: 1.57 +/- 0.18). Inter-rater reliability, estimated by the regression analysis, demonstrated that the proposed method was more reliable and reproducible than conventional methods [ANALYZE: correlation coefficient (CC)=0.341, Sig.=0.335 vs. proposed method: CC=0.816, Sig.=0.004]. The volume ratio of the whole cerebrum to the parceled object can be used to investigate structural abnormalities for the pathological detection of the various mental diseases such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Abstract: Inhaled hyperpolarized helium-3 (3He) gas is a new magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent that is being used to study lung functionality. To evaluate the total lung ventilation from the hyperpolarized 3He MR images, it is necessary to segment the lung cavities. This is difficult to accomplish using only the hyperpolarized 3He MR images, so traditional proton (1H) MR images are frequently obtained concurrent with the hyperpolarized 3He MR examination. Segmentation of the lung cavities from traditional proton (1H) MRI is a necessary first step in the analysis of hyperpolarized 3He MR images. In this paper, we develop an active contour model that provides a smooth boundary and accurately captures the high curvature features of the lung cavities from the 1H MR images. This segmentation method is the first parametric active contour model that facilitates straightforward merging of multiple contours. The proposed method of merging computes an external force field that is based on the solution of partial differential equations with boundary condition defined by the initial positions of the evolving contours. A theoretical connection with fluid flow in porous media and the proposed force field is established. Then by using the properties of fluid flow we prove that the proposed method indeed achieves merging and the contours stop at the object boundary as well. Experimental results involving merging in synthetic images are provided. The segmentation technique has been employed in lung 1H MR imaging for segmenting the total lung air space. This technology plays a key role in computing the functional air space from MR images that use hyperpolarized 3He gas as a contrast agent.

Abstract: We propose a shape-based approach to curve evolution for the segmentation of medical images containing known object types. In particular, motivated by the work of Leventon, Grimson, and Faugeras, we derive a parametric model for an implicit representation of the segmenting curve by applying principal component analysis to a collection of signed distance representations of the training data. The parameters of this representation are then manipulated to minimize an objective function for segmentation. The resulting algorithm is able to handle multidimensional data, can deal with topological changes of the curve, is robust to noise and initial contour placements, and is computationally efficient. At the same time, it avoids the need for point correspondences during the training phase of the algorithm. We demonstrate this technique by applying it to two medical applications; two-dimensional segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional segmentation of prostate MRI.

Abstract: This paper presents a new spectral signature detection approach to magnetic resonance (MR) image classification. It is called constrained energy minimization (CEM) method, which is derived from the minimum variance distortionless response in passive sensor array processing. It considers a bank of spectral channels as an array of sensors where each spectral channel represents a sensor and object spectral signature in multispectral MR images are viewed as signals impinging upon the array. The strength of the CEM lies on its ability in detection of spectral signatures of interest without knowing image background. The detected spectral signatures are then used for classification. The CEM makes use of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter to linearly constrain a desired object while minimizing interfering effects caused by other unknown signal sources. Unlike most spatial-based classification techniques, the proposed CEM takes advantage of spectral characteristics to achieve object detection and classification. A series of experiments is conducted and compared with the commonly used c-means method for performance evaluation. The results show that the CEM method is a promising and effective spectral technique for MR image classification.

Abstract: We explored the temporal dynamics of parietal and prefrontal cortex involvement in verbal working memory employing single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In six healthy volunteers the left or right inferior parietal and prefrontal cortex was stimulated with the aid of a frameless stereotactic system. TMS was applied at 10 different time points 140-500 ms into the delay period of a two-back verbal working memory task. A choice reaction task was used as a control task. Interference with task accuracy was induced by TMS earlier in the parietal cortex than in the prefrontal cortex and earlier over the right than the left hemisphere. This suggests a propagation of information flow from posterior to anterior cortical sites converging in the left prefrontal cortex. Significant interference with reaction time was observed after 180 ms with left prefrontal cortex stimulation. These effects were not observed in the control task, underlining the task specificity of our results. We propose that the interference with right-sided prefrontal cortex stimulation leads to impaired performance due to disturbed input into the left prefrontal cortex, whereas left-sided TMS interferes directly with the final information processing. Left- and right-sided brain areas might be involved in parallel processing of semantic and object features of the stimuli, respectively.

Abstract: We studied perception in three patients with prosopagnosia of childhood onset. All had trouble with other 'within-category' judgments. All were deficient on face matching tests and severely impaired on tests of perception of the spatial relations of facial features and abstract designs, indicating a deficit in the encoding of coordinate relationships, similar to adult-onset prosopagnosia with lesions of the fusiform face area. Two had difficulty perceiving feature colour, which correlated with reduced luminance sensitivity. In contrast to adult-onset patients, saturation discrimination was spared in two and spatial resolution impaired in two. Curvature discrimination was relatively spared. Contrast sensitivity showed variable reductions at different spatial frequencies. We conclude that developmental prosopagnosia is similar to the adult-onset form in encoding deficits for the spatial arrangement of facial elements. Deficits in luminance perception and spatial resolution are more associated with defective encoding for basic object-level recognition, as shown on tests of object and spatial perception.

Abstract: Repeated exposure to objects improves our ability to identify and name them, even after a long delay. Previous brain imaging studies have demonstrated that this experience-related facilitation of object naming is associated with neural changes in distinct brain regions. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the modulation of neural activity in the object naming system as a function of experience and time. Pictures of common objects were presented repeatedly for naming at different time intervals (1 h, 6 h and 3 days) before scanning, or at 30 s intervals during scanning. The results revealed that as objects became more familiar with experience, activity in occipitotemporal and left inferior frontal regions decreased while activity in the left insula and basal ganglia increased. In posterior regions, reductions in activity as a result of multiple repetitions did not interact with time, whereas in left inferior frontal cortex larger decreases were observed when repetitions were spaced out over time. This differential modulation of activity in distinct brain regions provides support for the idea that long-lasting object priming is mediated by two neural mechanisms. The first mechanism may involve changes in object-specific representations in occipitotemporal cortices, the second may be a form of procedural learning involving a reorganization in brain circuitry that leads to more efficient name retrieval.

Abstract: Moving dots can evoke a percept of the spatial structure of a three-dimensional object in the absence of other visual cues. This phenomenon, called structure from motion (SFM), suggests that the motion flowfield represented in the dorsal stream can form the basis of object recognition performed in the ventral stream. SFM processing is likely to contribute to object perception whenever there is relative motion between the observer and the object viewed. Here we investigate the motion flowfield component of object recognition with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our SFM stimuli encoded face surfaces and random three-dimensional control shapes with matched curvature properties. We used two different types of an SFM stimulus with the dots either fixed to the surface of the object or moving on it. Despite the radically different encoding of surface structure in the two types of SFM, both elicited strong surface percepts and involved the same network of cortical regions. From early visual areas, this network extends dorsally into the human motion complex and parietal regions and ventrally into object-related cortex. The SFM stimuli elicited a face-selective response in the fusiform face area. The human motion complex appears to have a central role in SFM object recognition, not merely representing the motion flowfield but also the surface structure of the motion-defined object. The motion complex and a region in the intraparietal sulcus reflected the motion state of the SFM-implicit object, responding more strongly when the implicit object was in motion than when it was stationary.

Abstract: A unique feature of Japanese language is that its written sentences consist of both morphograms (kanji) and syllabograms (kana). Despite extensive research by PET, functional MRI and magnetoencephalography, the issues of the difference (or the similarities) between the processing of kanji and kana, and between word reading and object/picture naming have not been resolved as yet. This study investigated the function of the posterior basal temporal area in the language dominant hemisphere in auditory and visual language processing, with special emphasis on semantic and phonological recognition. Subdural electrode grids were placed on the left temporal area of a right-handed woman with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy as part of a pre-surgical evaluation. Her dominant hemisphere for language was shown to be the left on the Wada test. Electric stimulation of 50 Hz was applied to the electrodes during the tasks related to language. Our results showed a clear distinction in the responses and/or performance of the subject depending on the type of characters presented and the tasks employed. Electric stimulation of a localized area in the posterior basal temporal lobe caused neither comprehensive nor productive deficit in the tasks using auditory stimuli. In the tasks using visual stimuli, in contrast, impairments were observed in (i) reading of kanji words and (ii) naming of objects/pictures and geometric designs, but not in (iii) reading of kana, (iv) copying of kanji, kana and geometric designs, and (v) using tools. The subject maintained full comprehension of spoken language, suggesting that the auditory tasks are not processed in the posterior basal temporal area. The fact that the impairment of kanji reading and disturbance of object/picture naming were elicited by electric stimulation of the same area indicates that there is at least one anatomical area that is used commonly for kanji (but not kana) and object processing. The conceptual entity of the test items supposedly was recognized correctly, but the concept failed to be matched to correct phonological representation. The left posterior basal temporal area, therefore, has an important function of connecting visual semantic information into phonological representation.

Abstract: Virtual reality was used to sequentially present objects within a town square and to test recognition of object locations from the same viewpoint as presentation, or from a shifted viewpoint. A developmental amnesic case with focal bilateral hippocampal pathology showed a massive additional impairment when tested from the shifted viewpoint compared with a mild, list length-dependent, impairment when tested from the same viewpoint. While the same-view condition could be solved by visual pattern matching, the shifted-view condition requires a viewpoint independent representation or an equivalent mechanism for translating or rotating viewpoints in memory. The latter mechanism was indicated by control subjects' response latencies in the shifted-view condition, although the amnesic case is not impaired in tests of mental rotation of single objects. These results show that the human hippocampus supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory, and suggest that it does so by providing a mechanism for viewpoint manipulation in memory. In addition, they suggest an extremely sensitive test for human hippocampal damage, and hint at the nature of the hippocampal role in episodic recollection.

Abstract: Functional imaging studies have demonstrated that processing of man-made objects activate the left ventral premotor cortex, which is known to be concerned with motor function. This has led to the suggestion that the comprehension of man-made objects may rely on motor-based knowledge of object utilization (action knowledge). Here we show that the left ventral premotor cortex is activated during categorization of "both" fruit/vegetables and articles of clothing, relative to animals and nonmanipulable man-made objects. This observation suggests that action knowledge may not be important for the processing of man-made objects per se, but rather for the processing of manipulable objects in general, whether natural or man-made. These findings both support psycholinguistic theories suggesting that certain lexical categories may evolve from, and the act of categorization rely upon, motor-based knowledge of action equivalency, and have important implications for theories of category specificity. Thus, the finding that the processing of vegetables/fruit and articles of clothing give rise to similar activation is difficult to account for should knowledge representations in the brain be truly categorically organized. Instead, the data are compatible with the suggestion that categories differ in the weight they put on different types of knowledge.

Abstract: Deformable models, originally proposed by Terzopoulos et al. (Artif. Intell. 36 (1988) 91) and Kass et al. (Int. J. Comput. Vision 1 (1988) 321) in 1988, have been widely used in medical image segmentation. However, they manifest two well-known limitations: the lack of an appropriate long-range force to drive the model surface towards the object boundary and poor performance at high curvature boundaries (such as corners) due to the models' intrinsic smoothness constraint. In this paper, a new smoothness force with local control is proposed. The local control is used to devise a long-range force, referred to as the self-zoom force, and a corner fitting force. The self-zoom force enables the model surface to expand and shrink without a limit in range. The corner fitting force propels the model surface to fit high-curvature boundaries. Experiments demonstrate that the model surface is driven to the object boundary by the new forces even if the initial estimate is not close and the object is nonconvex or has a high local curvature.

Abstract: This paper describes a new method of combining ray-casting with segmentation. Volume rendering is performed at interactive rates on personal computers, and visualizations include both "superficial" ray-casting through a shell at each object's surface and "deep" ray-casting through the confines of each object. A feature of the approach is the option to smoothly and interactively dilate segmentation boundaries along all axes. This ability, when combined with selective "turning off" of extraneous image objects, can help clinicians detect and evaluate segmentation errors that may affect surgical planning. We describe both a method optimized for displaying tubular objects and a more general method applicable to objects of arbitrary geometry. In both cases, select three-dimensional points are projected onto a modified z buffer that records additional information about the projected objects. A subsequent step selectively volume renders only through the object volumes indicated by the z buffer. We describe how our approach differs from other reported methods for combining segmentation with ray-casting, and illustrate how our method can be useful in helping to detect segmentation errors.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that selection for perceptual report is often limited to one object at a time, with elements being selected together if they belong to part of the same perceptual group. Here we used the neuropsychological phenomenon of extinction in human patients with parietal lesions to show that selection is influenced also by action relations between objects. Performance was better for objects that were positioned spatially so that they could be used together, relative to objects that were positioned inappropriately for their combined use. The action relation was critical, as performance for pictures did not improve if the items were only verbally associated. We found the opposite result with words. Effects of action relations emerged even on trials where only one object could be reported, showing implicit coding of 'action' units for selection. The effects of verbal associations may instead reflect priming between lexical entries.

Abstract: Functional neuroimaging studies in which the cortical organization for semantic knowledge has been addressed have revealed interesting dissociations in the recognition of different object categories, such as faces, natural objects, and manufactured objects. The present paper critically reviews these studies and performs a meta-analysis of stereotactic coordinates to determine whether category membership predicts patterns of brain activation across different studies. This meta-analysis revealed that, in the ventral temporal cortex, recognition of manufactured objects activates more medial aspects of the fusiform gyrus, as compared with natural object or face recognition. Face recognition activates more inferior aspects of the ventral temporal cortex, as compared with manufactured object recognition. The recognition task used--viewing, matching, or naming--also predicted brain activation patterns. Specifically, matching tasks recruit more inferior occipital regions than do either naming or viewing tasks, whereas naming tasks recruit more anterior ventral temporal sites than do either viewing or matching tasks. These findings indicate that the cognitive demands of a particular recognition task are as predictive of cortical activation patterns as is category membership.

Abstract: We report on two patients, TH and KN, with focal retrograde amnesia (FRA). Their memory loss regarding life events extended to their whole lives, whereas they could acquire and retain new information. They also showed prominent deficits in production and comprehension of common words. In addition, at least in the testing situation, they were impaired in their recognition and use of familiar objects. Although both cases of FRA followed an episode that can cause brain pathology, MRI revealed no structural abnormality in either patient. Stressful situations preceding the onset were evident in KN, but not in TH. We discuss their impairments of object knowledge from a neuropsychological perspective, and we interpret the etiology of their condition as a functional rather than a psychogenic amnesia.

Abstract: We investigated the degree to which the distributed and overlapping patterns of activity for working memory (WM) maintenance of objects and spatial locations are functionally dissociable. Previous studies of the neural system responsible for maintenance of different types of information in WM have reported seemingly contradictory results concerning the degree to which spatial and nonspatial information maintenance leads to distinct patterns of activation in prefrontal cortex. These inconsistent results may be partly attributable to the fact that different types of objects were used for the "object WM task" across studies. In the current study, we directly compared the patterns of response during WM tasks for face identity, house identity, and spatial location using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, independence of the neural resources available for spatial and object WM was tested behaviorally using a dual-task paradigm. Together, these results suggest that the mechanisms for the maintenance of house identity information are distributed and overlapping with those that maintain spatial location information, while the mechanisms for maintenance of face identity information are relatively more independent. There is, however, a consistent functional topography that results in superior prefrontal cortex producing the greatest response during spatial WM tasks, and middle and inferior prefrontal cortices producing their greatest responses during object WM tasks, independent of the object type. These results argue for a dorsal-ventral functional organization for spatial and nonspatial information. However, objects may contain both spatial and nonspatial information and, thus, have a distributed but not equipotent representation across both dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex.

Abstract: Twelve right-handed men performed two mental rotation tasks and two control tasks while whole-head functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied. Mental rotation tasks implied the comparison of different sorts of stimulus pairs, viz. pictures of hands and pictures of tools, which were either identical or mirror images and which were rotated in the plane of the picture. Control tasks were equal except that stimuli pairs were not rotated. Reaction time profiles were consistent with those found in previous research. Imaging data replicate classic areas of activation in mental rotation for hands and tools (bilateral superior parietal lobule and visual extrastriate cortex) but show an important difference in premotor area activation: pairs of hands engender bilateral premotor activation while pairs of tools elicit only left premotor brain activation. The results suggest that participants imagined moving both their hands in the hand condition, while imagining manipulating objects with their hand of preference (right hand) in the tool condition. The covert actions of motor imagery appear to mimic the "natural way" in which a person would manipulate the object in reality, and the activation of cortical regions during mental rotation seems at least in part determined by an intrinsic process that depends on the afforded actions elicited by the kind of stimuli presented.

Abstract: The organization of the normal perceptual processing subserving tactile object recognition is poorly understood. While perceptual deficits associated with cases of tactile agnosia may pinpoint sites of critical interference with normal tactile information processing, the precise character of such deficits remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore the behavioural and neuroanatomical correlates of perceptual disturbances in two cases of unilateral aperceptive tactile agnosia. Perception of microgeometrical and macrogeometrical features was tested using an alternative forced choice paradigm. While both patients were impaired in the assessment of microgeometrical properties of objects (i.e. detecting subtle differences in grating profiles), one patient showed an additional deficit in the perception of macrogeometrical properties of objects (i.e. detecting differences in length of cuboids). The pattern of perceptual deficits for both patients suggested a severely compromised (if not totally lost) ability to recognize everyday objects. Perceptual performance improved when the patients had complementary tactile information (i.e. for intramodal comparison), despite a persistent inability to explicitly name the objects. That is, the patients were able to recognize objects, but only implicitly. Improved perceptual performance was also observed when complementary visual information was available (i.e. transmodal information transfer). In this case, the perceptual improvement was accompanied by a corresponding improvement in explicit object recognition. High resolution MRIs identified lesions in the postcentral gyrus in both patients, and additionally in the secondary somatosensory area (SII) and the posterior parietal cortex in the more severely affected patient. The results demonstrate that the underlying failure in tactile agnosia is mainly impaired perception of microgeometrical properties of objects due to a lesion of primary sensory cortex. The related neuroanatomical findings suggest a degradation of serial information processing within postcentral gyrus. In one case tactile agnosia was almost complete due to additionally impaired perception of macrogeometrical properties of objects, which correlated with the extension of lesion to the posterior parietal cortex. Importantly, the findings indicate traces of two distributed networks for tactile information processing and the associated parallel processing of complementary micro- and macrogeometrical information within postcentral gyrus and posterior parietal lobe.

Abstract: The authors report the case of a woman with a right basal ganglia lesion and severe mental-rotation impairments. She had no difficulty recognizing rotated objects and had intact left-right orientation in egocentric space but was unable to map the left and right sides of external objects to her egocentric reference frame. This study indicates that the right basal ganglia may be critical components in a cortico-subcortical network involved in mental rotation. We speculate that the role of these structures is to select and maintain an appropriate motor program for performing smooth and accurate rotation. The results also have important implications for theories of object recognition by demonstrating that recognition of rotated objects can be achieved without mental rotation.

Abstract: Our concepts about objects, states, and events are stored in a cognitive structure termed semantic memory. There are several types of neurologic disorders that may cause impairments of semantic memory. Clinical evaluations of these impairments are complex, because semantic memory is linked to other cognitive systems that, when damaged, may produce related syndromes or difficulties. In an attempt to gain further understanding of these breakdown patterns, we review data from both neuropsychologic and brain activity research that have been concerned with how object concepts are represented and localized in the brain. Although these data have spawned varying and controversial views regarding the content and organization of semantic knowledge, converging evidence suggests that semantic memory is mainly localized in the posterior region of the left temporal lobe, and that particular categories of knowledge may be represented in different but overlapping regions within this area.

Abstract: We used fMRI to study the distribution of object category information in the ventral visual pathway. Extending the findings of, we find that categories of stimuli can be distinguished by the pattern of activation they elicit across this entire pathway, even when the stimuli within a category differ in viewpoint, exemplar, or image format. However, regions within the ventral visual pathway are neither interchangeable nor equipotential. Although the FFA and PPA permit excellent discrimination between preferred versus nonpreferred stimuli (e.g., faces-bottles and houses-bottles, respectively), we find that neither region alone permits accurate discrimination between pairs of nonpreferred stimuli (e.g., bottles-shoes). These findings indicate that the ventral visual pathway is not homogeneous, but contains some regions (including FFA and PPA) that are primarily involved in the analysis of a single class of stimulus.

Abstract: We describe psychophysical, neuropsychological and neuro-ophthalmological studies of visual abilities in a patient who, following a right hemisphere stroke, had difficulty in combining parts of objects into a whole and in reading. Strikingly, her perceptual problems were accentuated when the objects moved or when she moved. Formal testing showed that her main deficits were in depth perception, various tasks of motion and object recognition of degraded stimuli. But low-level detection and discrimination of form and color were normal. Despite her deficits in visual motion and degraded static-object recognition, her visual recognition of 'biological motion' stimuli was normal. Structural magnetic resonance imaging revealed an infarct in the ventro-medial occipito-temporal region, extending ventro-laterally and leading to a 'kaleidoscopic disintegration of visible objects'.

Abstract: Hypothesis testing in functional neuroimaging studies relies heavily on the computation of categorical contrasts in which brain activation associated with one experimental condition is assessed relative to brain activation associated with a different experimental condition. Often, multiple pair-wise contrasts are computed and reported independently. Here we describe an approach to hypothesis testing that logically combines multiple pair-wise contrasts to distinguish among selective, differential and conjoined brain activation patterns. Using a sample dataset in which participants viewed objects, visual noise patterns or a fixation cross, we demonstrate that selective and differential brain activation patterns are often confounded with current approaches to hypothesis testing but that the logical combination approach can distinguish between these two types of data patterns. Specifically, we show that brain regions that respond selectively to an object recognition task relative to viewing visual noise or a fixation cross (selective activation) are mutually exclusive from brain regions that show a graded response to object viewing, noise viewing and visual fixation (differential activation). We thus show that the logical combination approach sufficiently constrains the results of categorical contrasts to reflect only the data pattern that would be predicted from the cognitive processing account under investigation.

Abstract: Using fMRI, we showed that an area in the ventral temporo-occipital cortex (area vTO), which is part of the human homolog of the ventral stream of visual processing, exhibited priming for both identical and depth-rotated images of objects. This pattern of activation in area vTO corresponded to performance in a behavioral matching task. An area in the caudal part of the intraparietal sulcus (area cIPS) also showed priming, but only with identical images of objects. This dorsal-stream area treated rotated images as new objects. The difference in the pattern of priming-related activation in the two areas may reflect the respective roles of the ventral and dorsal streams in object recognition and object-directed action.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In anorthoscopic viewing conditions, observers can perceive a moving object through a narrow slit even when only portions of its contour are visible at any time. We used fMRI to examine the contribution of early and later visual cortical areas to dynamic shape integration. Observers' success at integrating the shape of the slit-viewed object was manipulated by varying the degree to which the stimulus was dynamically distorted. Line drawings of common objects were either moderately distorted, strongly distorted, or shown undistorted. Phenomenologically, increasing the stimulus distortion made both object shape and motion more difficult to perceive. RESULTS: We found that bilateral cortical activity in portions of the ventral occipital cortex, corresponding to known object areas within the lateral occipital complex (LOC), was inversely correlated with the degree of stimulus distortion. We found that activity in left MT+, the human cortical area specialized for motion, showed a similar pattern as the ventral occipital region. The LOC also showed greater activity to a fully visible moving object than to the undistorted slit-viewed object. Area MT+, however, showed more equivalent activity to both the slit-viewed and fully visible moving objects. CONCLUSIONS: In early retinotopic cortex, the distorted and undistorted stimuli elicited the same amount of activity. Higher visual areas, however, were correlated with the percept of the coherent object, and this correlation suggests that the shape integration is mediated by later visual cortical areas. Motion information from the dorsal stream may project to the LOC to produce the shape percept.

Abstract: An internal sense of eye position is necessary to maintain the constancy of the visual world in spite of movements of the eyes. Neuroimaging studies have localized human homologs of monkey visual motion processing areas in MT/MST and also in the collateral sulcus (V4), an area that codes features within objects. We show that these two areas have a baseline fMRI signal that is modulated by eye position and that the preferred direction of the eye position signal is different in the two areas; increasing for ipsiversive eye positions in MT/MST and increasing for contraversive eye positions within the collateral sulcus. This baseline modulation is a true eye position signal; one that is present in the absence of visual motion stimuli. The difference in the preferred direction of the eye position signal may reflect the different transformations in these two areas; a transformation from a retinotopic (eye-centered) to an egocentric coordinate frame necessary for guiding action and to an object-centered frame for object recognition.

Abstract: The organization of macaque posterior parietal cortex (PPC) reflects its functional specialization in integrating polymodal sensory information for object recognition and manipulation. Neuropsychological and recent human imaging studies imply equivalencies between human and macaque PPC, and in particular, the cortex buried in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Using functional MRI, we tested the hypothesis that an area in human anterior intraparietal cortex is activated when healthy subjects perform a crossmodal visuo-tactile delayed matching-to-sample task with objects. Tactile or visual object presentation (encoding and recognition) both significantly activated anterior intraparietal cortex. As hypothesized, neural activity in this area was further enhanced when subjects transferred object information between modalities (crossmodal matching). Based on both the observed functional properties and the anatomical location, we suggest that this area in anterior IPS is the human equivalent of macaque area AIP.

Abstract: We report a patient (ST) with predominant damage to the right neostriatum, caused by a rare cerebral angiitis. The testing procedure was focused on attentional set shifting (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; WCST) and habit learning (probabilistic classification learning; PCL). ST showed impairments in the WCST, digit span backward, alphabet span, and PCL procedures, whereas he exhibited spared IQ, short-term verbal memory, object recognition, episodic and semantic memory. After 1 month of steroid therapy, there was a significant improvement in the WCST, digit span backward and alphabet span tests, whereas PCL remained severely impaired. The three control patients with damage to the parietal lobe displayed normal learning rates in PCL. These results suggest that separate frontostriatal mechanisms exist for attentional set shifting and habit learning.

Abstract: We performed an fMRI one-back recognition study aimed at distinguishing the semantic versus perceptual aspects of how objects and their written forms are processed. There were three types of visually presented items: pictures (schematic drawings of objects); words identifying these objects; and a mixed condition in which pictures were interleaved with words. A semantic decision about object identity was required when pictures were interleaved with words. This condition, contrasted with the other two, invoked a larger signal in multiple areas, including frontal cortex, bilateral occipitotemporal cortex, and the right middle temporal gyrus. We propose that the left occipitotemporal and right temporal activations are indicative of the neural substrate mediating picture-word conversions, whereas the frontal activations reflect the coordinating functions of the central executive.

Abstract: We used fMRI to identify the brain areas related to the perception of biological motion (4 T EPI; whole brain). In experiment 1, 10 subjects viewed biological motion (a human figure jumping up and down, composed of 21 dots), alternating with a control stimulus created by applying autoregressive models to the biological motion stimulus (such that the dots' speeds and amplitudes were preserved whereas their linking structure was not). The lengths of the stimulus bouts varied, and therefore the transitions between biological motion and control stimuli were unpredictable. Subjects had to indicate with a button press when each transition occurred. In a related biological motion task, subjects detected short (1 s) disturbances within these displays. We also examined the neural substrates of motion and shape perception, as well as motor imagery, to determine whether or not the cortical regions involved in these processes are also recruited during biological motion perception. Subjects viewed linear motion displays alternating with static dots and a series of common objects alternating with band-limited white noise patterns. Subjects also generated imagery of their own arm movements alternating with visual imagery of common objects. Biological motion specific BOLD signal was found within regions of the lingual gyrus at the cuneus border, showing little overlap with object recognition, linear motion or motion imagery areas. The lingual gyrus activation was replicated in a second experiment that also mapped retinotopic visual areas in three subjects. The results suggest that a region of the lingual gyrus within VP is involved in higher-order processing of motion information.

Abstract: An important characteristic of visual perception is the fact that object recognition is largely immune to changes in viewing conditions. This invariance is obtained within a sequence of ventral stream visual areas beginning in area V1 and ending in high order occipito-temporal object areas (the lateral occipital complex, LOC). Here we studied whether this transformation could be observed in the contrast response of these areas. Subjects were presented with line drawings of common objects and faces in five different contrast levels (0, 4, 6, 10, and 100%). Our results show that indeed there was a gradual trend of increasing contrast invariance moving from area V1, which manifested high sensitivity to contrast changes, to the LOC, which showed a significantly higher degree of invariance at suprathreshold contrasts (from 10 to 100%). The trend toward increased invariance could be observed for both face and object images; however, it was more complete for the face images, while object images still manifested substantial sensitivity to contrast changes. Control experiments ruled out the involvement of attention effects or hemodynamic "ceiling" in producing the contrast invariance. The transition from V1 to LOC was gradual with areas along the ventral stream becoming increasingly contrast-invariant. These results further stress the hierarchical and gradual nature of the transition from early retinotopic areas to high order ones, in the build-up of abstract object representations.

Abstract: Knowledge about environmental objects derives from representations of multiple object features both within and across sensory modalities. While our understanding of the neural basis for visual object representation in the human and nonhuman primate brain is well advanced, a similar understanding of auditory objects is in its infancy. We used a name verification task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the neural circuits that are activated as human subjects match visually presented words with either simultaneously presented pictures or environmental sounds. The difficulty of the matching judgment was manipulated by varying the level of semantic detail at which the words and objects were compared. We found that blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal was modulated in ventral and dorsal regions of the inferior frontal gyrus of both hemispheres during auditory and visual object categorization, potentially implicating these areas as sites for integrating polymodal object representations with concepts in semantic memory. As expected, BOLD signal increases in the fusiform gyrus varied with the semantic level of object categorization, though this effect was weak and restricted to the left hemisphere in the case of auditory objects.

Abstract: Single-unit recordings from behaving monkeys and human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have continued to provide a host of experimental data on the properties and mechanisms of object recognition in cortex. Recent advances in object recognition, spanning issues regarding invariance, selectivity, representation and levels of recognition have allowed us to propose a putative model of object recognition in cortex.

Abstract: Recent fMRI studies indicate that the anterior fusiform gyrus (the fusiform face area, FFA) is specialized for face recognition. However, the analyses used to determine face selectivity have not ruled out the possibility that other object categories produce significant activation in the FFA, relative to baseline. In the current fMRI study, we use a conservative hypothesis testing approach to show that FFA activation is not selective for faces. Rather, the FFA response is almost completely explained by a graded response in which faces produce more activation than either manufactured or natural objects, but those categories produce a statistically greater response than the baseline task. These findings question whether the FFA can be interpreted as a specialized module for face recognition.

Abstract: In humans and many other primates, the visual system plays the major role in object recognition. But objects can also be recognized through haptic exploration, which uses our sense of touch. Nonetheless, it has been argued that the haptic system makes use of 'visual' processing to construct a representation of the object. To investigate possible interactions between the visual and haptic systems, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the effects of cross-modal haptic-to-visual priming on brain activation. Subjects studied three-dimensional novel clay objects either visually or haptically before entering the scanner. During scanning, subjects viewed visually primed, haptically primed, and non-primed objects. They also haptically explored non-primed objects. Visual and haptic exploration of non-primed objects produced significant activation in several brain regions, and produced overlapping activation in the middle occipital area (MO). Viewing visually and haptically primed objects produced more activation than viewing non-primed objects in both area MO and the lateral occipital area (LO). In summary, haptic exploration of novel three-dimensional objects produced activation, not only in somatosensory cortex, but also in areas of the occipital cortex associated with visual processing. Furthermore, previous haptic experience with these objects enhanced activation in visual areas when these same objects were subsequently viewed. Taken together, these results suggest that the object-representation systems of the ventral visual pathway are exploited for haptic object perception.

Abstract: OBJECT: To assess the validity of relying on atlases during stereotactic neurosurgery, the authors compared target coordinates in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) obtained using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with those determined using an atlas. The targets were used in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of generalized dystonia. METHODS: Thirty-five patients, who were treated using bilateral DBS of the GPi, were included in this study. The target was selected on three-dimensional MR images by direct visual recognition of the GPi. The coordinates were automatically recorded using dedicated software. They were translated into the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) coordinate system by using a matrix transformation process. The same GPi target was defined, based on the locations of brain structures shown in the atlases of Schaltenbrand and Talairach. Magnetic resonance imaging-based GPi target coordinates were statistically compared with the corresponding atlas-based coordinates by applying the Student t-test. A significant difference (p < 0.001) was demonstrated in x, y, and z directions between MR imaging-based and Schaltenbrand atlas-derived target coordinates. The comparison with normalized Talairach atlas coordinates demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the y and z directions, although not in the x direction (p = 0.12). No significant correlation existed between MR imaging-based target coordinates and patient age (p > 0.1). No significant correlation was observed between MR imaging-based target coordinates and patient sex in the y and z directions (p > 0.9), although it was significant in the x direction (p < 0.05). A significant variation in coordinates and the length of the AC-PC line was revealed only in the y direction (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: A significant difference was found between target coordinates obtained by direct visual targeting on MR images (validated by postoperative clinical results) and those obtained by indirect targeting based on atlases.

Abstract: We have recently proposed a center-periphery organization based on resolution needs, in which objects engaging in recognition processes requiring central-vision (e.g., face-related) are associated with center-biased representations, while objects requiring large-scale feature integration (e.g., buildings) are associated with periphery-biased representations. Here we tested this hypothesis by comparing the center-periphery organization with activations to five object categories: faces, buildings, tools, letter strings, and words. We found that faces, letter strings, and words were mapped preferentially within the center-biased representation. Faces showed a hemispheric lateralization opposite to that of letter strings and words. In contrast, buildings were mapped mainly to the periphery-biased representation, while tools activated both central and peripheral representations. The results are compatible with the notion that center-periphery organization allows the optimal allocation of cortical magnification to the specific requirements of various recognition processes.

Abstract: We conducted two event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to investigate the neural substrates of visual object recognition in humans. We used a repetition-priming method with visual stimuli recurring at unpredictable intervals, either with the same appearance or with changes in size, viewpoint or exemplar. Lateral occipital and posterior inferior temporal cortex showed lower activity for repetitions of both real and non-sense objects; fusiform and left inferior frontal regions showed decreases for repetitions of only real objects. Repetition of different exemplars with the same name affected only the left inferior frontal cortex. Crucially, priming-induced decreases in activity of the right fusiform cortex depended on whether the three-dimensional objects were repeated with the same viewpoint, regardless of whether retinal image size changed; left fusiform decreases were independent of both viewpoint and size. These data show that dissociable subsystems in ventral visual cortex maintain distinct view-dependent and view-invariant object representations.

Abstract: The first steps in the process of reading a printed word belong to the domain of visual object perception. They culminate in a representation of letter strings as an ordered set of abstract letter identities, a representation known as the Visual Word Form (VWF). Brain lesions in patients with pure alexia and functional imaging data suggest that the VWF is subtended by a restricted patch of left-hemispheric fusiform cortex, which is reproducibly activated during reading. In order to determine whether the operation of this Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) depends exclusively on the visual features of stimuli, or is influenced by language-dependent parameters, brain activations induced by words, consonant strings and chequerboards were compared in normal subjects using functional MRI (fMRI). Stimuli were presented in the left or right visual hemifield. The VWFA was identified in both a blocked-design experiment and an event-related experiment as a left-hemispheric inferotemporal area showing a stronger activation to alphabetic strings than to chequerboards, and invariant for the spatial location of stimuli. In both experiments, stronger activations of the VWFA to words than to strings of consonants were observed. Considering that the VWFA is equally activated by real words and by readable pseudowords, this result demonstrates that the VWFA is initially plastic and becomes attuned to the orthographic regularities that constrain letter combination during the acquisition of literacy. Additionally, the use of split-field stimulation shed some light on the cerebral bases of the classical right visual field (RVF) advantage in reading. A left occipital extrastriate area was found to be activated by RVF letter strings more than by chequerboards, while no symmetrical region was observed in the right hemisphere. Moreover, activations in the precuneus and the left thalamus were observed when subjects were reading RVF versus left visual field (LVF) words, and are likely to reflect the attentional component of the RVF advantage.

Abstract: Naming pictures of objects from different categories (e.g. animals or tools) evokes maximal responses in different brain regions. However, these 'category-specific' regions typically respond to other object categories as well. Here we used stimulus familiarity to further investigate category representation. Naming pictures of animals and tools elicited category-related activity in a number of previously identified regions. This activity was reduced for familiar relative to novel stimuli. Reduced activation occurred in all object responsive areas in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, regardless of which category initially produced the maximal response. This suggests that object representations in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex are not limited to a discrete area, but rather are widespread and overlapping. In other regions (e.g. the lateral temporal and left premotor cortices), experience-dependent reductions were category specific. Together, these findings suggest that category-related activations reflect the retrieval of information about category-specific features and attributes.

Abstract: This functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates commonalties and differences in working memory (WM) processes employing different types of stimuli. We specifically sought to characterize topographic convergence and segregation with respect to prefrontal cortex involvement using verbal, spatial, real object and shape memory items in a two-back WM task. Both the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices are conjointly activated across all stimulus types. No stimulus-specific differences in the activation patterns of the prefrontal cortex could be demonstrated giving support to the view of an amodal prefrontal involvement during WM processes. However, extra-frontal regions specialized on feature processing and involved in the preprocessing of the stimuli were selectively activated by these different subtypes of WM. These selectively activated regions are assigned to parts of the ventral and dorsal stream.

Abstract: We report evidence from a PET activation study that the inferior occipital gyri (likely to include area V2) and the posterior parts of the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri are involved in the integration of visual elements into perceptual wholes (single objects). Of these areas, the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri were more activated by tasks with recognizable stimuli than by tasks with unrecognizable stimuli. We propose that the posterior parts of the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri, compared with the inferior occipital gyri, are involved in higher level integration, due to the involvement of re-entrant activation from stored structural knowledge. Evidence in favor of this interpretation comes from the additional finding that activation of the anterior part of the left fusiform gyrus and a more anterior part of the right inferior temporal gyrus, areas previously associated with access to stored structural knowledge, was found with recognizable stimuli, but not with unrecognizable stimuli. This latter finding also indicates: (i) that subjects may not refrain from (automatically) identifying objects even if they only have to attend to the objects' global shape, and (ii) that perceptual and memorial processes can be dissociated on both functional and anatomical grounds. No evidence was obtained for the involvement of the parietal lobes in the integration of single objects.

Abstract: We measured brain activity during mental rotation and object recognition with objects rotated around three different axes. Activity in the superior parietal lobe (SPL) increased proportionally to viewpoint disparity during mental rotation, but not during object recognition. In contrast, the fusiform gyrus was preferentially recruited in a viewpoint-dependent manner in recognition as compared to mental rotation. In addition, independent of the effect of viewpoint, object recognition was associated with ventral areas and mental rotation with dorsal areas. These results indicate that the similar behavioral effects of viewpoint obtained in these two tasks are based on different neural substrates. Such findings call into question the hypothesis that mental rotation is used to compensate for changes in viewpoint during object recognition.

Abstract: It has been proposed that object perception can proceed through different routes, which can be situated on a continuum ranging from complete viewpoint-dependency to complete viewpoint-independency, depending on the objects and the task at hand. Although these different routes have been extensively demonstrated on the behavioral level, the corresponding distinction in the underlying neural substrate has not received the same attention. Our goal was to disentangle, on the behavioral and the neurofunctional level, a process associated with extreme viewpoint-dependency, i.e. mental rotation, and a process associated with extreme viewpoint-independency, i.e. the use of viewpoint-invariant, diagnostic features. Two sets of 3-D block figures were created that either differed in handedness (original versus mirrored) or in the angles joining the block components (orthogonal versus skewed). Behavioral measures on a same-different judgment task were predicted to be dependent on viewpoint in the rotation condition (same versus mirrored), but not in the invariance condition (same angles versus different angles). Six subjects participated in an fMRI experiment while presented with both conditions in alternating blocks. Both reaction times and accuracy confirmed the predicted dissociation between the two conditions. Neurofunctional results indicate that all cortical areas activated in the invariance condition were also activated in the rotation condition. Parietal areas were more activated than occipito-temporal areas in the rotation condition, while this pattern was reversed in the invariance condition. Furthermore, some areas were activated uniquely by the rotation condition, probably reflecting the additional processes apparent in the behavioral response patterns.

Abstract: The functional organization of working memory (WM) in the human prefrontal cortex remains unclear. Storage and processing functions might be segregated in ventral and dorsal areas of the prefrontal cortex, respectively. If so, storage functions might be spared, irrespective of informational domain, following damage or dysfunction in dorsolateral areas. Alternatively, WM and prefrontal function in general might be segregated according to informational domains (e.g. spatial versus object-based information). In the present study we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to directly test these competing hypotheses. We applied rTMS to transiently and selectively disrupt the function of the dorsomedial, dorsolateral or ventral prefrontal cortex in normal human volunteers performing either a spatial or a face-recognition delayed-response task. Performance in the spatial task was impaired by rTMS of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Performance in the face-recognition (non-spatial) task was impaired by rTMS of the ventral prefrontal cortex. Transient disruption of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affected performance in both tasks. These findings provide evidence of domain-specific segregation of WM functions in widely separated areas of prefrontal cortex.

Abstract: The present experiment tested predictions of a 'perceptual-mnemonic/feature conjunction' (PMFC) model of perirhinal cortex function. The model predicts that lesions of perirhinal cortex should disrupt complex visual discriminations with a high degree of 'feature ambiguity', a property of visual discrimination problems that can emerge when features of an object are rewarded when they are part of one object, but not when part of another. As feature ambiguity is thought to be the critical factor, such effects should be independent of the number of objects to be discriminated. This was tested directly, by assessing performance of control monkeys and monkeys with aspiration lesions of perirhinal cortex on a series of concurrent discriminations in which the number of object pairs was held constant, but the degree of feature ambiguity was varied systematically. Monkeys were tested in three conditions: Maximum Feature Ambiguity, in which all features were explicitly ambiguous (AB+, CD+, BC-, AD-; the biconditional problem); Minimum Feature Ambiguity, in which no features were explicitly ambiguous (AB+, CD+, EF-, GH-); and Intermediate Feature Ambiguity, in which half the features were explicitly ambiguous (AB+, CD+, CE-, AF-). The pattern of results closely matched that predicted by simulations using a connectionist network: monkeys with perirhinal cortex lesions were unimpaired in the Minimum Feature Ambiguity condition, mildly impaired in the Intermediate Feature Ambiguity condition and severely impaired in the Maximum Feature Ambiguity condition. These results confirm the predictions of the PMFC model, and force a reconsideration of prevailing views regarding perirhinal cortex function.

Abstract: Object related areas in the human ventral stream were previously shown to be activated, in a shape-selective manner, by luminance, motion, and texture cues. We report on the preferential activation of these areas by stereo cues defining shape. To assess the relationship of this activation to object recognition, we employed a perceptual stereo effect, which profoundly affects object recognition. The stimuli consisted of stereo-defined line drawings of objects that either protruded in front of a flat background ("front"), or were sunk into the background ("back"). Despite the similarity in the local feature structure of the two conditions, object recognition was superior in the "front" compared to the "back" configuration. We measured both recognition rates and fMRI signal from the human visual cortex while subjects viewed these stimuli. The results reveal shape selective activation from images of objects defined purely by stereoscopic cues in the human ventral stream. Furthermore, they show a significant correlation between recognition and fMRI signal in the object-related occipito-temporal cortex (lateral occipital complex).

Abstract: According to a classical view of visual object recognition, targets are detected "pre-attentively" if they carry unique features, whereas attention has to be deployed serially to object locations for feature binding if the targets can be distinguished from distracters only in terms of their feature conjunctions. Consistent with this view, recent reports suggest a contribution of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC; one major region controlling spatial attention) to conjunction search as opposed to feature search. However, PPC engagement in conjunction search might also reflect feature-based attention or the difficulty of target selection. The present fMRI study compared regions and amplitudes of cortical activity reflecting the attention mechanisms of a conjunction and a feature search of equal difficulty performed during maintenance of fixation. Attention-related activity was assessed by comparing each hard feature and conjunction search with an easy feature search. Hard feature and conjunction search activated overlapping regions in multiple PPC areas and in the frontal eye field (FEF). Most consistent PPC overlaps were located in the anterior and posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The response amplitude of posterior IPS did not differ between both search tasks. However, the IPS junction with the transverse occipital sulcus and the FEF responded at a higher amplitude during conjunction search. Moreover, regions of the prefrontal cortex and the PPC were activated only during either hard feature or conjunction search. These findings suggest that equally difficult visual searches for features and conjunctions are controlled by overlapping frontoparietal networks, but also that both search types involve specific mechanisms.

Abstract: The ability of the human visual system to recognize partially occluded objects is a striking feat, which has received extensive psychophysical documentation. Here we studied the manifestation of completion effects in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation of high-order object areas (the lateral occipital complex - LOC). Subjects were presented with three types of images: (i) whole line drawings of animal or unfamiliar shapes ('whole'); (ii) the same shapes, occluded by parallel stripes which occupied roughly half of the surface area of the images ('grid'); and (iii) the same stripes, 'scrambled' so that the relative position of the regions between the stripes was changed while the local feature structure remained intact. Behavioral measurements showed a high degree of object completion in the 'grid' condition, but not in the 'scrambled' condition. The fMRI results show a significantly higher activation to the 'grid' images compared to the 'scrambled' images. This enhanced activation indicates the operation of non-local completion effects, since the local features in both sets of images were the same. The cortical regions showing the highest 'completion' effects co-localized with regions in the LOC which showed the highest activation to the 'whole' images compared to the 'scrambled' images. Activation in early retinotopic areas was similar in both the 'grid' and the 'scrambled' conditions. Our results point to the LOC as a central site in which object completion effects are manifested.

Abstract: The feasibility of recording event-related potentials (ERP) during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning using higher level cognitive stimuli was studied. Using responses to illusory figures in a visual oddball task, evoked potentials were obtained with their expected configurations and latencies. A rapid stimulation scheme using randomly varied trial lengths was employed, and class-wise characteristics of the hemodynamic response were obtained by a nonlinear analysis of the fMRI time series. Implications and limitations of conducting combined ERP-fMRI experiments using higher level cognitive stimuli are discussed. EEG/fMRI results revealed a sequential activation of striate and extrastriate occipital cortex along the ventral path of object processing for Kanizsa figures. Interestingly, Kanizsa figures activated the human motion area MT. Targets resulted in activations of frontal and parietal cortex which were not activated for standard stimuli.

Abstract: Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested a specific role of the extrastriate cortex in letter string and visual word form processing. However, this region has been shown to be involved in object recognition and its specificity for the processing of linguistic stimuli may be questioned. The authors used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design with category priming to record the response elicited by the passive viewing of single letters, geometric figures, and of the categorically ambiguous stimulus "O" that pertains to both sets of familiar symbols. Bilateral activations in the extrastriate cortex were found, with a left predominance particularly pronounced for the ambiguous stimulus. Individual analysis of spatial extent and signal intensity showed a priming x stimulus x hemisphere interaction. When primed by the congruous categoric set, a bilateral decrease in activation was observed for letters and geometric figures. The ambiguous stimulus behaved as a letter for the left hemisphere, with decreased activation when primed by letters, whereas in the right hemisphere, an adaptation effect occurred when primed by geometric figures. These priming effects suggest that, for the ambiguous stimulus, letter processing was systematically involved in the left extrastriate cortex. The current results support the existence of a neural substrate for the abstract category of letters.

Abstract: Disorders of tactile object recognition (TOR) may result from primary motor or sensory deficits or higher cognitive impairment of tactile shape representations or semantic memory. Studies with healthy participants suggest the existence of exploratory motor procedures directly linked to the extraction of specific properties of objects. A pure deficit of these procedures without concomitant gnostic disorders has never been described in a brain-damaged patient. Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere. We interpret the deficit of our patient as a pure tactile apraxia without tactile agnosia, i.e. a specific inability to use tactile feedback to generate the exploratory procedures necessary for tactile shape recognition.

Abstract: The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.

Abstract: Recent neuroimaging studies have described a differential activation pattern associated with specific object images (e.g., face-related and building-related activation) in human occipito-temporal cortex. However, it is as yet unclear to what extent this selectivity is due to differences in the statistics of local object features present in the different object categories, and to what extent it reflects holistic grouping processes operating across the entire object image. To resolve this question it is essential to use images in which identical sets of local features elicit the perception of different object categories. The classic Rubin vase-face illusion provides an excellent experimental set to test this question. In the illusion, the same local contours lead to the perception of different objects (vase or face). Here we employed a modified Rubin vase-face illusion to explore to what extent the activation in face-related regions is attributable to the presence of local face features, or is due to a more holistic grouping process that involves the entire face figure. Biasing cues (gratings and color) were used to control the perceptual state of the observer. We found enhanced activation in face-related regions during the "face profile" perceptual state compared to the "vase" perceptual state. Control images ruled out the involvement of the biasing cues in the effect. Thus, object-selective activation in human face-related regions entails global grouping processes that go beyond the local processing of stimulus features.

Abstract: This functional MRI study examined how people mentally rotate a 3-dimensional object (an alarm clock) that is retrieved from memory and rotated according to a sequence of auditory instructions. We manipulated the geometric properties of the rotation, such as having successive rotation steps around a single axis versus alternating between 2 axes. The latter condition produced much more activation in several areas. Also, the activation in several areas increased with the number of rotation steps. During successive rotations around a single axis, the activation was similar for rotations in the picture plane and rotations in depth. The parietal (but not extrastriate) activation was similar to mental rotation of a visually presented object. The findings indicate that a large-scale cortical network computes different types of spatial information by dynamically drawing on each of its components to a differential, situation-specific degree.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on blind adults resting and reading Braille. The strongest activation was found in primary somatic sensory/motor cortex on both cortical hemispheres. Additional foci of activation were situated in the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes where visual information is processed in sighted persons. The regions were differentiated most in the correlation of their time courses of activation with resting and reading. Differences in magnitude and expanse of activation were substantially less significant. Among the traditionally visual areas, the strength of correlation was greatest in posterior parietal cortex and moderate in occipitotemporal, lateral occipital, and primary visual cortex. It was low in secondary visual cortex as well as in dorsal and ventral inferior temporal cortex and posterior middle temporal cortex. Visual experience increased the strength of correlation in all regions except dorsal inferior temporal and posterior parietal cortex. The greatest statistically significant increase, i.e., approximately 30%, was in ventral inferior temporal and posterior middle temporal cortex. In these regions, words are analyzed semantically, which may be facilitated by visual experience. In contrast, visual experience resulted in a slight, insignificant diminution of the strength of correlation in dorsal inferior temporal cortex where language is analyzed phonetically. These findings affirm that posterior temporal regions are engaged in the processing of written language. Moreover, they suggest that this function is modified by early visual experience. Furthermore, visual experience significantly strengthened the correlation of activation and Braille reading in occipital regions traditionally involved in the processing of visual features and object recognition suggesting a role for visual imagery.

Abstract: The human lateral occipital complex (LOC) has been implicated in object recognition, but it is unknown whether this region represents low-level image features or perceived object shape. We used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm in which the response to pairs of successively presented stimuli is lower when they are identical than when they are different. Adaptation across a change between the two stimuli in a pair provides evidence for a common neural representation invariant to that change. We found adaptation in the LOC when perceived shape was identical but contours differed, but not when contours were identical but perceived shape differed. These data indicate that the LOC represents not simple image features, but rather higher level shape information.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The perceptual ability of humans and monkeys to identify objects in the presence of noise varies systematically and monotonically as a function of how much noise is introduced to the visual display. That is, it becomes more and more difficult to identify an object with increasing noise. Here we examine whether the blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) signal in anesthetized monkeys also shows such monotonic tuning. We employed parametric stimulus sets containing natural images and noise patterns matched for spatial frequency and intensity as well as intermediate images generated by interpolation between natural images and noise patterns. Anesthetized monkeys provide us with the unique opportunity to examine visual processing largely in the absence of top-down cognitive modulations and can thus provide an important baseline against which work with awake monkeys and humans can be compared. RESULTS: We measured BOLD activity in occipital visual cortical areas as natural images and noise patterns, as well as intermediate interpolated patterns at three interpolation levels (25%, 50%, and 75%) were presented to anesthetized monkeys in a block paradigm. We observed reliable visual activity in occipital visual areas including V1, V2, V3, V3A, and V4 as well as the fundus and anterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Natural images consistently elicited higher BOLD levels than noise patterns. For intermediate images, however, we did not observe monotonic tuning. Instead, we observed a characteristic V-shaped noise-tuning function in primary and extrastriate visual areas. BOLD signals initially decreased as noise was added to the stimulus but then increased again as the pure noise pattern was approached. We present a simple model based on the number of activated neurons and the strength of activation per neuron that can account for these results. CONCLUSIONS: We show that, for our parametric stimulus set, BOLD activity varied nonmonotonically as a function of how much noise was added to the visual stimuli, unlike the perceptual ability of humans and monkeys to identify such stimuli. This raises important caveats for interpreting fMRI data and demonstrates the importance of assessing not only which neural populations are activated by contrasting conditions during an fMRI study, but also the strength of this activation. This becomes particularly important when using the BOLD signal to make inferences about the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

Abstract: Recently, we identified, using fMRI, three bilateral regions in the ventral temporal cortex that responded preferentially to faces, houses, and chairs [Ishai, A., Ungerleider, L. G., Martin, A., Schouten, J. L., & Haxby, J. V. (1999). Distributed representation of objects in the human ventral visual pathway. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 96, 9379--9384]. Here, we report differential patterns of activation, similar to those seen in the ventral temporal cortex, in bilateral regions of the ventral occipital cortex. We also found category-related responses in the dorsal occipital cortex and in the superior temporal sulcus. Moreover, rather than activating discrete, segregated areas, each category was associated with its own differential pattern of response across a broad expanse of cortex. The distributed patterns of response were similar across tasks (passive viewing, delayed matching) and presentation formats (photographs, line drawings). We propose that the representation of objects in the ventral visual pathway, including both occipital and temporal regions, is not restricted to small, highly selective patches of cortex but, instead, is a distributed representation of information about object form. Within this distributed system, the representation of faces appears to be less extensive as compared to the representations of nonface objects.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to study memory for the spatial context of controlled but lifelike events. Subjects received a set of objects from two different people in two different places within a VR environment. Memory for the objects, and for where and from whom they were received was tested by putting the subject back into a place in the company of a person and giving a paired forced choice of objects. In four conditions objects had to be chosen according to different criteria: which was received in that place, which was received from that person, which object was recognized, and which object was widest. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during testing to identify areas involved in retrieval of the spatial context of an event. A network of areas was identified consisting of a temporoparietal pathway running between the precuneus and parahippocampi via retrosplenial cortex and the parieto-occipital sulcus, left hippocampus, bilateral posterior parietal, dorsolateral, ventrolateral and anterior prefrontal cortices, and the anterior cingulate. Of these areas the parahippocampal, right posterior parietal, and posteriodorsal medial parietal areas were specifically involved in retrieval of spatial context compared to retrieval of nonspatial context. The posterior activations are consistent with a model of long-term storage of allocentric representations in medial temporal regions with translation to body-centered and head-centered representations computed in right posterior parietal cortex and buffered in the temporoparietal pathway so as to provide an imageable representation in the precuneus. Prefrontal activations are consistent with strategic retrieval processes, including those required to overcome the interference between the highly similar events.

Abstract: A strong correspondence has been repeatedly observed between actually performed and mentally imagined object rotation. This suggests an overlap in the brain regions involved in these processes. Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently revealed parietal and occipital cortex activity during dynamic visuospatial imagery. However, results concerning the involvement of higher-order cortical motor areas have been less consistent. We investigated if and when premotor structures are active during processing of a three-dimensional cube comparison task that requires dynamic visuospatial imagery. In order to achieve a good temporal and spatial resolution, single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp-recorded event-related slow cortical potentials (SCPs) were recorded from the same subjects in two separate measurement sessions. In order to reduce inter-subject variability in brain activity due to individual differences, only male subjects (n = 13) with high task-specific ability were investigated. Functional MRI revealed consistent bilateral activity in the occipital (Brodmann area BA18/19) and parietal cortex (BA7), in lateral and medial premotor areas (BA6), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9), and the anterior insular cortex. The time-course of SCPs indicated that task-related activity in these areas commenced approximately 550-650 ms after stimulus presentation and persisted until task completion. These results provide strong and consistent evidence that the human premotor cortex is involved in dynamic visuospatial imagery.

Abstract: We present a case of multimodal agnosia in the visual and tactile modality due to an infarction in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery. The patient's ability to recognize objects fluctuated depending on his verbal activity. When he misnamed presented objects, he tended to use them and to draw them in keeping with the wrong name. We submit that the mechanism causing associative agnosia is more dynamic than it was hitherto considered. It originates from the rivalry between top-down central regulation and bottom-up peripheral flow.

Abstract: We report a technique for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an awake, co-operative, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) in a conventional 1.5T clinical MR scanner, thus accomplishing the first direct comparison of activation in visual cortex between humans and non-human primates with fMRI. Activation was seen in multiple areas of striate and extra-striate visual cortex and in areas for motion, object and face recognition in the monkey and in homologous visual areas in a human volunteer. This article describes T1, T2 and T2* values for macaque cortex, suitable MR imaging sequences, a training schedule, stimulus delivery apparatus and restraining hardware for monkey fMRI using a conventional 19 cm knee coil. Much of our understanding of the functional organization of the primate brain comes from physiological studies in monkeys. Direct comparison between species using fMRI such as those described here will help us to relate the wealth of existing knowledge on the functional organization of the non-human primate brain to human fMRI.

Abstract: After decades of research the notion that faces are special is still at the heart of heated debates. New techniques like brain imaging have advanced some of the arguments but empirical data from brain-damaged patients like paradoxical recognition effects have required more complex explanations aside from localisation of the face area in normal adults. In this paper we focus on configural face processes and discuss configural processes in prosopagnosics in the light of findings obtained in brain-imaging studies. In order to account for data like paradoxical face recognition effects we propose a dual route model of face recognition. The model is based on the distinction between two separate aspects of face recognition, detection and identification, considered as dynamical and interrelated. In this perspective the face detection system appears as the stronger candidate for face-specific processes. The face identification system on the other hand is part of the object recognition system but derives its specificity in part from interaction with the face-specific detection system. The fact that face detection appears intact in some patients provides us with a possible explanation for the interference of configural processes on feature-based identification.

Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in research effectively integrating cognitive psychology, functional neuroimaging, and behavioral neurology. This new work is typically conducting basic research into aspects of the human mind and brain. The present review features as examples of such integrations two series of studies by the author and his colleagues. One series, employing object recognition, mental motor imagery, and mental rotation paradigms, clarifies the nature of a cognitive process, imagined spatial transformations used in shape recognition. Among other implications, it suggests that when recognizing a hand's handedness, imagining one's body movement depends on cerebrally lateralized sensory-motor structures and deciding upon handedness depends on exact match shape confirmation. The other series, using cutaneous, tactile, and auditory pitch discrimination paradigms, elucidates the function of a brain structure, the cerebellum. It suggests that the cerebellum has non-motor sensory support functions upon which optimally fine sensory discriminations depend. In addition, six key issues for this integrative approach are reviewed. These include arguments for the value and greater use of: rigorous quantitative meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies; stereotactic coordinate-based data, as opposed to surface landmark-based data; standardized vocabularies capturing the elementary component operations of cognitive and behavioral tasks; functional hypotheses about brain areas that are consistent with underlying microcircuitry; an awareness that not all brain areas implicated by neuroimaging or neurology are necessarily directly involved in the associated cognitive or behavioral task; and systematic approaches to integrations of this kind.

Abstract: We discuss the relations between functional imaging and cognitive neuropsychological research. We begin by elaborating on some of the problems of traditional neuropsychological research, which attempted to provide accounts of cognitive performance at a neural as well as at a functional level of description. The difficulties in making neural-level arguments from neuropsychological data include: problems of associated deficits, problems due to interactive effects between brain regions, problems with analyses based on behavioural syndromes, problems due to the influence of compensatory strategies, and problems in separating damaged from disconnected representations. We discuss how cognitive neuropsychology by-passed many of these problems by emphasising functional rather than neural-level theories, though problems with inferences at the neural-level remain. We then consider the contribution that functional imaging can make to cognitive neuropsychology. Using evidence drawn from studies of language, object recognition and visual attention, we argue that functional imaging complements cognitive neuropsychology by: (i) not being reliant on accidents of nature and by enabling effects of lesions on 'distant' neural areas to be measured, (ii) revealing the brain systems necessary and sufficient for a given task, (iii) providing tests of neural-level models of cognition, and by (iv) providing novel evidence on the mechanisms of functional recovery in patients. In addition to this, imaging studies can contribute directly to functional-level theories, by providing converging evidence on the neural locus of cognition--knowing 'where' can allow new inferences about 'how' a given task is performed.

Abstract: We report on two brain-damaged subjects who exhibit the uncommon pattern of loss of object color knowledge, but spared color perception and naming. The subject P.C.O., as in previously reported patients, is also impaired in processing other perceptual and functional properties of objects. I.O.C., in contrast, is the first subject on record to have impaired object color knowledge, but spared knowledge of object form, size and function. This pattern of performance is consistent with the view that semantic information about color and other perceptual properties of objects is grounded in modality-specific systems. Lesion analysis suggests that such grounding requires the integrity of the mesial temporal regions of the left hemisphere.

Abstract: Here we review recent findings that reveal the functional properties of extra-striate regions in the human visual cortex that are involved in the representation and perception of objects. We characterize both the invariant and non-invariant properties of these regions and we discuss the correlation between activation of these regions and recognition. Overall, these results indicate that the lateral occipital complex plays an important role in human object recognition.

Abstract: Recent functional brain imaging studies suggest that object concepts may be represented, in part, by distributed networks of discrete cortical regions that parallel the organization of sensory and motor systems. In addition, different regions of the left lateral prefrontal cortex, and perhaps anterior temporal cortex, may have distinct roles in retrieving, maintaining and selecting semantic information.

Abstract: How are objects represented in the human visual cortex? Two conflicting theories suggest either a holistic representation, in which objects are represented by a collection of object templates, or a part-based representation, in which objects are represented as collections of features or object parts. We studied this question using a gradual object-scrambling paradigm in which pictures of objects (faces and cars) were broken in a stepwise manner into an increasing number of blocks. Our results reveal a hierarchical axis oriented anterior--posteriorly in the organization of ventral object-areas. Along this axis, representations are arranged in bands of increasing sensitivity to image scrambling. The axis starts in early visual areas through retinotopic areas V4/V8 and continues into the lateral-occipital sulcus dorsally and the posterior fusiform girus ventrally, corresponding together to the previously described object-related lateral occipital complex (LOC). Regions showing the highest sensitivity to scrambling tended to be located at the most anterior-lateral regions of the complex. In these more anterior regions, breaking the images into 16 parts produced a significant reduction in activation. Interestingly, activation was not affected when images were cut in two halves, either horizontally or vertically. Car images generally produced a weaker activation compared to faces in the lateral occipital complex but showed the same tendency of increased scrambling sensitivity along the anterior--posterior axis. These results suggest the existence of a hierarchical axis along ventral occipito-temporal object-areas, in which the neuronal properties shift from sensitivity to local object features to a more global and holistic representation.

Abstract: The cortical mechanisms associated with conscious object recognition were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were required to recognize pictures of masked objects that were presented very briefly, randomly and repeatedly. This design yielded a gradual accomplishment of successful recognition. Cortical activity in a ventrotemporal visual region was linearly correlated with perception of object identity. Therefore, although object recognition is rapid, awareness of an object's identity is not a discrete phenomenon but rather associated with gradually increasing cortical activity. Furthermore, the focus of the activity in the temporal cortex shifted anteriorly as subjects reported an increased knowledge regarding identity. The results presented here provide new insights into the processes underlying explicit object recognition, as well as the analysis that takes place immediately before and after recognition is possible.

Abstract: This study presents a rare case of developmental prosopagnosia. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no overt brain abnormalities. EP's basic visual skills and visual memory were intact, as was his ability to judge age, sex and expression from faces, identify facial parts, and make face/non-face decisions. EP was impaired at recognizing famous and very familiar faces and describing visual images of famous faces. He also displayed an anterograde memory impairment for recently studied faces, and performed poorly on tests of unfamiliar face matching, most notably for chimeric faces. It is suggested that EP may be deficient at encoding configural representations of faces. EP appears to have a "pure" (i.e. specific to faces) prosopagnosia, as he shows normal object recognition from unusual viewpoints, good gestalt completion for objects, but not for faces, normal visual imagery for objects but not for faces, a disruption of the inversion effect for faces but not for houses, and performs within the normal range on tests of within-category discriminations, even with unique exemplars of object categories such as famous buildings.

Abstract: The ventral pathway is involved in primate visual object recognition. In humans, a central stage in this pathway is an occipito-temporal region termed the lateral occipital complex (LOC), which is preferentially activated by visual objects compared to scrambled images or textures. However, objects have characteristic attributes (such as three-dimensional shape) that can be perceived both visually and haptically. Therefore, object-related brain areas may hold a representation of objects in both modalities. Using fMRI to map object-related brain regions, we found robust and consistent somatosensory activation in the occipito-temporal cortex. This region showed clear preference for objects compared to textures in both modalities. Most somatosensory object-selective voxels overlapped a part of the visual object-related region LOC. Thus, we suggest that neuronal populations in the occipito-temporal cortex may constitute a multimodal object-related network.

Abstract: We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 12 healthy subjects to measure cerebral activation related to a set of higher order manual sensorimotor tasks performed in the absence of visual guidance. Purposeless manipulation of meaningless plasticine lumps served as a reference against which we contrasted two tasks where manual manipulation served a meaningful purpose, either the perception and recognition of three-dimensional shapes or the construction of such shapes out of an amorphous plasticine lump. These tasks were compared with the corresponding mental imagery of the modelling process which evokes the constructive concept but lacks concomitant sensorimotor input and output. Neural overlap was found in a bilateral activity increase in the posterior and anterior intraparietal sulcus area (IPS and AIP). Differential activation was seen in the supplementary and cingulate motor areas, the left M1 and the superior parietal lobe for modelling and in the left angular and ventral premotor cortex for imagery. Our data thus point to a congruent neural substrate for both perceptive and constructive object-oriented sensorimotor cognition in the AIP and posterior IPS. The leftward asymmetry of the inferior parietal activations, including the angular gyrus, during imagery of modelling along with the ventral premotor activations emphasize the close vicinity of the circuitry for cognitive manipulative motor behaviour and language.

Abstract: Seeing an object on one occasion may facilitate or prime processing of the same object if it is later again encountered. Such priming may also be found -- but at a reduced level -- for different but perceptually similar objects that are alternative exemplars or 'tokens' of the initially presented object. We explored the neural correlates of this perceptual specificity using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) procedures, contrasting neural activity when participants made object classification decisions (size judgments) regarding previously presented objects (repeated same), alternative exemplars of previously presented objects (repeated different), or entirely new objects (novel). Many frontal regions (including bilateral frontal operculum, bilateral posterior inferior frontal/precentral, left anterior inferior frontal, and superior frontal cortices) and multiple late visual and posterior regions (including middle occipital, fusiform, fusiform-parahippocampal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate, all bilaterally), demonstrated reduced neural activity for repeated compared to novel objects. Greater repetition-induced reductions were observed for same than for different exemplars in several of these regions (bilateral posterior inferior frontal, right precuneus, bilateral middle occipital, bilateral fusiform, bilateral parahippocampal and bilateral superior parietal). Additionally, right fusiform (occipitotemporal) cortex showed significantly less priming for different versus same exemplars than did left fusiform. These findings converge with behavioral evidence from divided visual field studies and with neuropsychological evidence underscoring the key role of right occipitotemporal cortex in processing specific visual form information; possible differences in the representational-functional role of left fusiform are discussed.

Abstract: Visual perception of houses, faces, and chairs evoke differential responses in ventral temporal cortex. Using fMRI, we compared activations evoked by perception and imagery of these object categories. We found content-related activation during imagery in extrastriate cortex, but this activity was restricted to small subsets of the regions that showed category-related activation during perception. Within ventral temporal cortex, activation during imagery evoked stronger responses on the left whereas perception evoked stronger responses on the right. Additionally, visual imagery evoked activity in parietal and frontal cortex, but this activity was not content related. These results suggest that content-related activation during imagery in visual extrastriate cortex may be implemented by "top-down" mechanisms in parietal and frontal cortex that mediate the retrieval of face and object representations from long-term memory and their maintenance through visual imagery.

Abstract: A single exposure to an object can produce long-lasting behavioral change. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we provide evidence for long-lasting changes in cortical activity associated with perceiving and naming objects. In posterior regions, we observed an immediate (30-second) and long-lasting (3-day) decrease in neural activity after brief (200-ms) exposure to nameable and nonsense objects. In addition, slower-developing decreases in left inferior frontal activity were observed concurrently with increases in left insula activity, only for nameable objects. These time-dependent cortical changes may reflect two distinct learning mechanisms: the formation of sparser, yet more object-form-specific, representations in posterior regions, and experience-induced reorganization of the brain circuitry underlying lexical retrieval in anterior regions.

Abstract: Neuroimaging studies show that prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortical regions are part of a working memory network that supports the active retention of information. In two experiments we used fMRI to examine whether prefrontal and posterior cortical areas are organized in a content-specific way for object and spatial working memory. Subjects performed a delayed matching-to-sample task modified to allow the examination of content-specific retention processes, independent of perceptual and decision-related processes. In Experiment 1, either unfamiliar geometrical objects (Klingon letters from an artificial alphabet unknown to the participants) or their spatial locations had to be memorized, whereas in Experiment 2, either unfamiliar faces or biological objects (butterflies) were actively memorized. All tasks activated a similar cortical network including posterior parietal (banks of the intraparietal sulcus), premotor (banks of the inferior precentral sulcus) and prefrontal regions (banks of the inferior frontal sulcus), and the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA). For geometrical objects and faces for which strategic semantic processing can be assumed, this activation was larger in the left than in the right hemisphere, whereas a bilateral or right dominant distribution was obtained for butterflies and spatial locations. The present results do not support the process-specific or content-specific view of the role of the prefrontal cortex in working memory task. Rather, they suggest that the inferior prefrontal cortex houses nonmemonic strategic processing systems required for response selection and task management that can flexibly be used across a variety of tasks and informational domains.

Abstract: Magnetic field tomography (MFT) was used to extract estimates for distributed source activity from average and single trial MEG signals recorded while subjects identified objects (including faces) and facial expressions of emotion. Regions of interest (ROIs) were automatically identified from the MFT solutions of the average signal for each subject. For one subject the entire set of MFT estimates obtained from unaveraged data was also used to compute simultaneous time series for the single trial activity in different ROIs. Three pairs of homologous areas in each hemisphere were selected for further analysis: posterior calcarine sulcus (PCS), fusiform gyrus (FM), and the amygdaloid complex (AM). Mutual information (MI) between each pair of the areas was computed from all single trial time series and contrasted for different tasks (object or emotion recognition) and categories within each task. The MI analysis shows that through feed-forward and feedback linkages, the "computation" load associated with the task of identifying objects and emotions is spread across both space (different ROIs and hemispheres) and time (different latencies and delays in couplings between areas)-well within 200 ms, different objects separate first in the right hemisphere PCS and FG coupling while different emotions separate in the right hemisphere FG and AM coupling, particularly at latencies after 200 ms.

Abstract: A variety of processes contribute to successful recognition memory, some of which can be associated with spatiotemporally distinct event-related potential old/new effects. An early frontal and a subsequent parietal old/new effect are correlated with the familiarity and recollection subcomponents of recognition memory, respectively, whereas a late, postretrieval old/new effect seems to reflect an ensemble of evaluation processes that are set by the task context in which retrieval occurs. Both the early frontal and the parietal old/new effects are differentially modulated by the informational content (e.g., object forms and spatial locations) of recognition and seem to rely on brain systems damaged in amnesia. The late frontal effect appears to reflect prefrontal cortex activation. A neurophysiologically based model of recognition memory retrieval is presented and it is shown that coupling recognition memory subprocesses with distinct old/new effects allow examination of the time course of the processes that contribute to correct and to illusory memories. In conjunction with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns the brain systems recruited by various aspects of episodic memory retrieval can be identified.

Abstract: Searching for a target object in a cluttered visual scene requires active visual attention if the target differs from distractors not by elementary visual features but rather by a feature conjunction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human subjects to investigate the functional neuroanatomy of attentional mechanisms employed during conjunction search. In the experimental condition, subjects searched for a target defined by a conjunction of colour and orientation. In the baseline condition, subjects searched for a uniquely coloured target, regardless of its orientation. Eye movement recordings outside the scanner verified subjects' ability to maintain fixation during search. Reaction times indicated that the experimental condition was attentionally more demanding than the baseline condition. Differential activations between conditions were therefore ascribed to top-down modulation of neural activity. The frontal eye field, the ventral precentral sulcus and the following posterior parietal regions were consistently activated: (i) the postcentral sulcus; (ii) the posterior; and (iii) the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus; and (iv) the junction of the intraparietal with the transverse occipital sulcus. Parietal regions were spatially distinct and displayed differential amplitudes of signal increase with a maximal amplitude in the posterior intraparietal sulcus. Less consistent activation was found in the lateral fusiform gyrus. These results suggest an involvement of the human frontal eye field in covert visual selection of potential targets during search. These results also provide evidence for a subdivision of posterior parietal cortex in multiple areas participating in covert visual selection, with a major contribution of the posterior intraparietal sulcus.

Abstract: Our understanding of the neural basis of object recognition is based primarily on work with non-human primates. The problem has recently been addressed in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging; new results indicate that the lateral occipital complex plays an important role in human object recognition.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recognizing an object is improved by recent experience with that object even if one cannot recall seeing the object. This perceptual facilitation as a result of previous experience is called priming. In neuroimaging studies, priming is often associated with a decrease in activation in brain regions involved in object recognition. It is thought that this occurs because priming causes a sharpening of object representations which leads to more efficient processing and, consequently, a reduction in neural activity. Recent evidence has suggested, however, that the apparent effect of priming on brain activation may vary as a function of whether the neural activity is measured before or after recognition has taken place. RESULTS: Using a gradual 'unmasking' technique, we presented primed and non-primed objects to subjects, and measured activation time courses using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As the objects were slowly revealed, but before recognition had occurred, activation increased from baseline level to a peak that corresponded in time to the subjects' behavioural recognition responses. The activation peak for primed objects occurred sooner than the peak for non-primed objects, and subjects responded sooner when presented with a primed object than with a non-primed object. During this pre-recognition phase, primed objects produced more activation than non-primed objects. After recognition, activation declined rapidly for both primed and non-primed objects, but now activation was lower for the primed objects. CONCLUSIONS: Priming did not produce a general decrease in activation in the brain regions involved in object recognition but, instead, produced a shift in the time of peak activation that corresponded to the shift in time seen in the subjects' behavioural recognition performance.

Abstract: An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study of prefrontal cortex was conducted during which subjects performed a visual "oddball" target detection task. Exemplars of three stimulus categories were presented at a rate of one per 1.5 sec for 10 runs, each consisting of 132 trials. Standards were color squares of varying sizes that were presented on approximately 92% of trials. Targets were color circles of varying sizes presented irregularly on approximately 4% of trials. Novels were pictures of everyday objects that were also presented irregularly on approximately 4% of trials. Ten subjects participated in two separate sessions in which they were required to count mentally or to push a button whenever a target appeared. Targets evoked activation within prefrontal cortex, primarily within the middle frontal gyri (MFG). This MFG activation did not differ as a function of the required response. Novels did not evoke significant activity within this region despite evidence from a separate behavioral and event-related potential study demonstrating their strong influence on processing. In additional imaging sessions with two subjects, the rules were reversed to require a button press whenever an object, but not a circle, appeared. These former novels now evoked activation in the MFG, but the former target circles did not. These experiments indicate that MFG activation is reliably evoked by exemplars from arbitrary stimulus categories that are mapped by experimental rules onto an arbitrary covert or overt response.

Abstract: Boucart and Humphreys reported an automatic access to object identity when observers attend to a physical property of the form of an object (e.g. the orientation) but not to its colour. We sought evidence for automatic identification in a brain imaging study using fMRI. In an orientation decision task participants decided whether a picture was vertical or horizontal. In the colour decision task participants decided if a picture was blue or green. Activation of areas 18-19 was found for both color and orientation. Activation of the temporal area 37 occurred more frequently in the orientation than in the colour decision task. This result suggests that automatic identification activates the same brain area as overt processing of semantic information.

Abstract: We report an event-related functional magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) experiment that investigates the relationship of transient visual object memory, visuospatial orienting, and object recognition. Delayed object matching and visuospatial orienting involved a highly overlapping network of brain areas. Common areas were the frontal eye fields (FEF), the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)/SMA complex, the precentral gyri, and the horizontal and descending branches of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Selective delay activation was observed anterior to the FEF and in the ascending part of the IPS. Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was involved in goal-directed visual search, but showed no delay activity.

Abstract: According to modular models of cortical organization, many areas of the extrastriate cortex are dedicated to object categories. These models often assume an early processing stage for the detection of category membership. Can functional imaging isolate areas responsible for detection of members of a category, such as faces or letters? We consider whether responses in three different areas (two selective for faces and one selective for letters) support category detection. Activity in these areas habituates to the repeated presentation of one exemplar more than to the presentation of different exemplars of the same category, but only for the category for which the area is selective. Thus, these areas appear to play computational roles more complex than detection, processing stimuli at the individual level. Drawing from prior work, we suggest that face-selective areas may be involved in the perception of faces at the individual level, whereas letter-selective regions may be tuning themselves to font information in order to recognize letters more efficiently.

Abstract: Visual extinction is a sign classically associated with right parietal damage. The patient can see a single stimulus presented in the ipsilesional or contralesional visual field, but is characteristically unaware of the same contralesional stimulus during simultaneous stimulation of both fields. The ipsilesional stimulus is said to 'extinguish' the contralesional stimulus from awareness during bilateral stimulation, perhaps due to a pathological bias in attention towards the ipsilesional side. Recent psychophysical evidence suggests that, although extinguished stimuli are not consciously seen, they may undergo residual processing and exert implicit effects on performance. However, the neural structures mediating such residual processing for extinguished stimuli remain unknown. Here we studied the neural activity evoked by an extinguished visual stimulus, using event-related functional MRI (fMRI), in a patient with circumscribed right inferior parietal damage and profound left-sided extinction. Monochrome objects (faces or houses) were presented in the left or right field, either unilaterally or bilaterally on each trial, with the patient indicating by button press whether he saw an object on the left, the right or on both sides. He usually saw only the right object on bilateral trials, yet the fMRI data showed activation of visual cortex contralateral to the extinguished left stimulus on these trials (compared with right-only stimulation), in both striate and early extrastriate areas of the right hemisphere. This activity had a similar location and time-course to that resulting from a single stimulus in the left versus right visual field. Cortical pathways involved in the normal processing of a single seen stimulus can thus still be activated by an unseen, extinguished stimulus after right parietal damage. Comparison of fMRI responses for faces versus houses revealed some category-specific activation for extinguished stimuli in right fusiform regions, but only at low statistical threshold. These results are discussed in terms of theoretical accounts for parietal extinction and, more generally, for the neural substrates of visual awareness.

Abstract: To investigate the relationship between perceptual awareness and brain activity, we measured both recognition performance and fMRI signal from object-related areas in human cortex while images were presented briefly using a masking protocol. Our results suggest that recognition performance is correlated with selective activation in object areas. Selective activation was correlated to object naming when exposure duration was varied from 20 to 500 milliseconds. Subjects' recognition during identical visual stimulation could be enhanced by training, which also increased the fMRI signal. Overall, the correlation between recognition performance and fMRI signal was highest in occipitotemporal object areas (the lateral occipital complex).

Abstract: To investigate the role of human fusiform gyrus in shape processing, we determined the effect of shape degradation on BOLD contrast in this region with fMRI during three tasks requiring subjects to determine either whether two successively presented nonsense shapes had the same global orientation (OR task); whether two successively presented meaningful objects belonged to the same basic level category (CAT task); or whether two successively presented objects represented the same exemplar of a category (EX task). On the behavioral level, shape degradation by locally shifting the pixels constituting the lines of stimuli had no effect on performance in the OR task, while it was detrimental to performance in the CAT and EX tasks. In comparison to the OR task, both the CAT and EX tasks were associated with activations in the occipitotemporal and parietal cortex. When shape degradation was applied, activation in the middle fusiform gyrus was reduced in all tasks. The occurrence of this effect in the OR task indicates that it is independent of memory representations. The persistence of the effect in both tasks that showed a behavioral effect of degradation suggests that it does not reflect the amount of shape processing performed on the stimuli, but rather the specificity of the final perceptual representation that can be built from the shape information that is available. Other studies have shown effects of stimulus familiarity and task requirements in the fusiform gyrus, suggesting that there is no need to assume different modules for perceptual representation and representation in memory.

Abstract: There is much evidence in primates' visual processing for distinct mechanisms involved in object recognition and encoding object position and motion, which have been identified with 'ventral' and 'dorsal' streams, respectively, of the extra-striate visual areas [1] [2] [3]. This distinction may yield insights into normal human perception, its development and pathology. Motion coherence sensitivity has been taken as a test of global processing in the dorsal stream [4] [5]. We have proposed an analogous 'form coherence' measure of global processing in the ventral stream [6]. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we found that the cortical regions activated by form coherence did not overlap with those activated by motion coherence in the same individuals. Areas differentially activated by form coherence included regions in the middle occipital gyrus, the ventral occipital surface, the intraparietal sulcus, and the temporal lobe. Motion coherence activated areas consistent with those previously identified as V5 and V3a, the ventral occipital surface, the intraparietal sulcus, and temporal structures. Neither form nor motion coherence activated area V1 differentially. Form and motion foci in occipital, parietal, and temporal areas were nearby but showed almost no overlap. These results support the idea that form and motion coherence test distinct functional brain systems, but that these do not necessarily correspond to a gross anatomical separation of dorsal and ventral processing streams.

Abstract: In a previous report ([5]: Davidoff J & Warrington EK. The bare bones of object recognition: implications from a case of object recognition impairment. Neuropsychologia 1999;37:279-92) the inability to differentiate between mirror images was recorded in a patient with excellent canonical view recognition. We now extend our investigation to a patient (JBA) with probable Alzheimer's disease in whom canonical view recognition was compromised. The reciprocal inhibition of two aspects of object processing are demonstrated in JBA. The patient's ability to detect mirror image rotations was dependent on her inability to identify the object. Paradoxically, her performance was more impaired for those stimuli that she was able to identify than those she was not.

Abstract: Five patients with a diagnosis of Herpes Simplex Virus Encephalitis (HSVE) underwent neuropsychological assessment to explore the integrity of their visual perceptual abilities. Selective deficits affecting different levels of the recognition processing were found; impaired recognition abilities were also influenced by selective task requirements, which resulted either in facilitatory or constraining effects on patients' performance. A theoretical model of object recognition (Humphreys & Riddoch, 1987) was taken into account to explain patients' performance. Further, the role of specific components of visual processing was evidenced in explaining the performance of patients affected by HSVE.

Abstract: The experiments presented in this report were designed to test the hypothesis that visual working memory for spatial stimuli and for object stimuli recruits separate neuronal networks in prefrontal cortex. We acquired BOLD fMRI data from subjects while they compared each serially presented stimulus to the one that had appeared two or three stimuli previously. Three experiments failed to reject the null hypothesis that prefrontal cortical activity associated with spatial working memory performance cannot be dissociated from prefrontal cortical activity associated with nonspatial working memory performance. Polymodal regions of parietal cortex (inferior and superior parietal lobules), as well as cortex surrounding the superior frontal sulcus (and encompassing the frontal eye fields), also demonstrated equivalent levels of activation in the spatial and object conditions. Posterior cortical regions associated with the ventral visual processing stream (portions of lingual, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri), however, demonstrated greater object than spatial working memory-related activity, particularly when stimuli varied only along spatial or featural dimensions. These experiments, representing fMRI studies of spatial and object working memory in which the testing procedure and the stimuli were identical in the two conditions, suggest that domain-specific visual working memory processing may be mediated by posterior regions associated with domain-specific sensory processing.

Abstract: The functional equivalence of overt movements and dynamic imagery is of fundamental importance in neuroscience. Here, we investigated the participation of the neocortical motor areas in a classic task of dynamic imagery, Shepard and Metzler's mental rotation task, by time-resolved single-trial functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The subjects performed the mental-rotation task 16 times, each time with different object pairs. Functional images were acquired for each pair separately, and the onset times and widths of the activation peaks in each area of interest were compared to the response times. We found a bilateral involvement of the superior parietal lobule, lateral premotor area, and supplementary motor area in all subjects; we found, furthermore, that those areas likely participate in the very act of mental rotation. We also found an activation in the left primary motor cortex, which seemed to be associated with the right-hand button press at the end of the task period.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been extensively used to explore the functional neuroanatomy of cognitive functions. Here we review 275 PET and fMRI studies of attention (sustained, selective, Stroop, orientation, divided), perception (object, face, space/motion, smell), imagery (object, space/motion), language (written/spoken word recognition, spoken/no spoken response), working memory (verbal/numeric, object, spatial, problem solving), semantic memory retrieval (categorization, generation), episodic memory encoding (verbal, object, spatial), episodic memory retrieval (verbal, nonverbal, success, effort, mode, context), priming (perceptual, conceptual), and procedural memory (conditioning, motor, and nonmotor skill learning). To identify consistent activation patterns associated with these cognitive operations, data from 412 contrasts were summarized at the level of cortical Brodmann's areas, insula, thalamus, medial-temporal lobe (including hippocampus), basal ganglia, and cerebellum. For perception and imagery, activation patterns included primary and secondary regions in the dorsal and ventral pathways. For attention and working memory, activations were usually found in prefrontal and parietal regions. For language and semantic memory retrieval, typical regions included left prefrontal and temporal regions. For episodic memory encoding, consistently activated regions included left prefrontal and medial temporal regions. For episodic memory retrieval, activation patterns included prefrontal, medial temporal, and posterior midline regions. For priming, deactivations in prefrontal (conceptual) or extrastriate (perceptual) regions were consistently seen. For procedural memory, activations were found in motor as well as in non-motor brain areas. Analysis of regional activations across cognitive domains suggested that several brain regions, including the cerebellum, are engaged by a variety of cognitive challenges. These observations are discussed in relation to functional specialization as well as functional integration.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recognition of individual faces is an integral part of both interpersonal interactions and successful functioning within a social group. Therefore, it is of considerable interest that individuals with autism and related conditions have selective deficits in face recognition (sparing nonface object recognition). METHOD: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study face and subordinate-level object perception in 14 high-functioning individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome (the autism group), in comparison with 2 groups of matched normal controls (normal control group ] [NC1] and normal control group 2 [NC2]) (n = 14 for each). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in NC1 and then applied in comparisons between NC2 and the autism group. Regions of interest were also defined in NC2 and then applied to comparisons between NC1 and the autism group as a replication study. RESULTS: In the first set of comparisons, we found significant task x group interactions for the size of activation in the right fusiform gyrus (FG) and right inferior temporal gyri (ITG). Post hoc analyses showed that during face (but not object) discrimination, the autism group had significantly greater activation than controls in the right ITG and less activation of the right FG. The replication study showed again that the autism group used the ITG significantly more for processing faces than the control groups, but for these analyses, the effect was now on the left side. Greater ITG activation was the pattern found in both control groups during object processing. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders demonstrate a pattern of brain activity during face discrimination that is consistent with feature-based strategies that are more typical of nonface object perception.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the neural substrates responsible for Japanese kana mirror reading. Japanese kana words, arranged vertically from top to bottom, were used in the mirror reading task in 10 normal right-handed Japanese adults. Since both mirror-reversed and normally oriented kana items are read in the same (top to bottom) direction, it was possible to minimize the oculomotor effects which often occur in the process of mirror reading of alphabetical language. By using the SPM96 random effect analysis method, a significant increase in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal during mirror reading relative to normal reading was detected in multiple brain regions, including the bilateral superior occipital gyri, bilateral middle occipital gyri corresponding to Brodmann area (BA) 18/19, bilateral lingual gyri (BA 19), left inferior occipital gyrus (BA 18), left inferior temporal cortex (BA 37), bilateral fusiform gyri (BA 19), right superior parietal cortex (SPC) (BA 7), left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45) and an inferior part of the left BA 6. In addition to these cortical regions, the right caudate nucleus and right cerebellum were also activated. The activation found in the right SPC and the left inferior temporal region is consistent with the hypothesis that mirror reading involves both the dorsal visuospatial and ventral object recognition pathways. In particular, a significant correlation was found between the fMRI signal change in the right SPC and the behavioural performance (error index) in the task. This may reflect increased demand on the right SPC for the spatial transformation which is required for the accurate recognition of mirror-reversed kana items. This relationship between the haemodynamic response in a specific brain area and the behavioural data provides new evidence for the essential role of the right SPC in Japanese kana mirror reading.

Abstract: Implicit memory refers to nonconscious retrieval of past experience demonstrated by facilitation in test performance on tasks that do not require intentional recollection of previous experiences. Explicit memory, in contrast, refers to the conscious retrieval of prior information, as demonstrated during standard recall and recognition tasks. In this experiment, positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), a marker of local neuronal activity, were used to identify and contrast brain regions that participate in the perception, implicit memory, and explicit memory for structurally possible and impossible visual objects. Ten CBF images were acquired in 16 normal women as they made possible/impossible and old/new recognition decisions about previously studied (old) and nonstudied (new) structurally possible and impossible objects. As reported previously, object decisions for familiar possible objects were associated with increased CBF in the vicinity of the left inferior temporal and fusiform gyri and recognition memory for familiar possible objects was associated with increased CBF in the vicinity of the right hippocampus. In this report, we provide more extensive analyses of the roles of the inferior temporal cortex, the hippocampus, the parahippocampus, and the pulvinar in encoding and retrieval operations. Additionally, patterns of CBF increases and decreases provide information regarding the neural structures involved in implicit and explicit memory.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: When we view static scenes that imply motion - such as an object dropping off a shelf - recognition memory for the position of the object is extrapolated forward. It is as if the object in our mind's eye comes alive and continues on its course. This phenomenon is known as representational momentum and results in a distortion of recognition memory in the implied direction of motion. Representational momentum is modifiable; simply labelling a drawing of a pointed object as 'rocket' will facilitate the effect, whereas the label 'steeple' will impede it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural substrate for representational momentum. RESULTS: Subjects participated in two experiments. In the first, they were presented with video excerpts of objects in motion (versus the same objects in a resting position). This identified brain areas responsible for motion perception. In the second experiment, they were presented with still photographs of the same target items, only some of which implied motion (representational momentum stimuli). When viewing still photographs of scenes implying motion, activity was revealed in secondary visual cortical regions that overlap with areas responsible for the perception of actual motion. Additional bilateral activity was revealed within a posterior satellite of V5 for the representational momentum stimuli. Activation was also engendered in the anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the implicit nature of representational momentum and its modifiability, the findings suggest that higher-order semantic information can act on secondary visual cortex to alter perception without explicit awareness.

Abstract: Recognition of a specific visual target among equally familiar distracters requires neural mechanisms for tracking items in working memory. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence for two such mechanisms: (i) Enhanced neural responses, primarily in the frontal cortex, were associated with the target and were maintained across repetitions of the target. (ii) Reduced responses, primarily in the extrastriate visual cortex, were associated with stimulus repetition, regardless of whether the stimulus was a target or a distracter. These complementary neural mechanisms track the status of familiar items in working memory, allowing for the efficient recognition of a currently relevant object and rejection of irrelevant distracters.

Abstract: The mechanisms involved in visual object recognition from non-canonical viewpoints were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used a passive observation task and found three areas activated more strongly in the non-canonical viewing condition compared with the canonical viewing condition. First, it was found that the fusiform gyrus and posterior part of the inferior temporal cortex were involved in the processing of shape information. Next, it was found that the posterior parietal cortex, mainly the superior parietal lobule and the ventral part of premotor area were involved in visuospatial processing and accessing sensorimotor knowledge. These results may indicate that recognition from non-canonical viewpoints is supported by using functional properties of the object, which require more real-time processing for object manipulation.

Abstract: OBJECT: In this paper the authors demonstrate the concordance between magnetic source (MS) imaging and direct cortical stimulation for mapping receptive language cortex. METHODS: In 13 consecutive surgical patients, cortex specialized for receptive language functions was identified noninvasively by obtaining activation maps aided by MS imaging in the context of visual and auditory word-recognition tasks. Surgery was then performed for treatment of medically intractable seizure disorder (eight patients), and for resection of tumor (four), or angioma (one). Mapping of language areas with cortical stimulation was performed intraoperatively in 10 patients and extraoperatively in three. Cortical stimulation mapping verified the accuracy of the MS imaging-based localization in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Information provided by MS imaging can be especially helpful in cases of atypical language representation, including bihemispheric representation, and location of language in areas other than those expected within the dominant hemisphere, such as the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, the posteroinferior portion of the middle temporal gyrus, the basal temporal cortex, and the lateral temporooccipital cortex.

Abstract: In the present positron emission tomography (PET) study, we examine the effect of a scopolamine-induced challenge to encoding upon the pattern of regional cerebral blood flow during recognition of a list of abstract visual shapes 3 days after encoding of these shapes. This study was conducted to test hypotheses concerning the fusiform and thalamic contributions to object recognition arising from a previous imaging study of impaired recognition. In that study, we demonstrated that activity in the fusiform cortex and the thalamus during shape recognition was modulated by memory challenges. These memory challenges included, on one hand, impaired storage as a consequence of diazepam administration during encoding, and, on the other hand, impaired retrieval caused by a perceptual challenge. Activation in the fusiform cortex decreased during impaired recognition, irrespective of the type of challenge. In contrast, thalamic activation increased only when the recognition deficit resulted from impaired memory storage. Based on these results, we hypothesized that fusiform activation during recognition reflects the matching of an incoming stimulus with a stored one, whereas thalamic activation reflects retrieval attempts. These hypotheses would receive considerable support if scopolamine, which also impairs memory storage, induced similar modulations of fusiform and thalamic activation. In the present study, we observed that a scopolamine challenge to encoding does indeed modulate the activity in the very same regions that were previously modulated by a diazepam challenge. Hence, a similar memory deficit, although primarily effected through different neurochemical pathways, was paralleled by a similar modulation of activity in the same set of nodes in the shape recognition network. In the fusiform cortex, scopolamine decreased recognition-related activity, as did the sensory challenge of retrieval. Furthermore, covariate analysis demonstrated that the level of fusiform activity linearly correlates with behavioural performance. In the thalamus, activation increased following impaired encoding. This is in accordance with the idea that enhanced thalamic activity reflects increased effort expended in retrieval. In addition, in the intraparietal sulcus, differential activation also increased following impaired memory storage, possibly reflecting enhanced visuospatial attention in an effort to compensate for impaired performance.

Abstract: The purpose of the present PET study was (i) to investigate the neural correlates of object recognition, i.e. the matching of visual forms to memory, and (ii) to test the hypothesis that this process is more difficult for natural objects than for artefacts. This was done by using object decision tasks where subjects decided whether pictures represented real objects or non-objects. The object decision tasks differed in their difficulty (the degree of perceptual differentiation needed to perform them) and in the category of the real objects used (natural objects versus artefacts). A clear effect of task difficulty was found in both the behavioural and in the PET data. In the PET data, the increase in task difficulty was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow in the posterior part of the right inferior temporal gyrus and in the anterior part of the right fusiform gyrus. This may be the neural correlate of matching visual forms to memory, and the amount of activation in these regions may correspond to the degree of perceptual differentiation required for recognition to occur. With respect to behaviour, it took significantly longer to make object decisions on natural objects than on artefacts in the difficult object decision tasks. Natural objects also recruited larger parts of the right inferior temporal and anterior fusiform gyri compared with artefacts as task difficulty increased. Differences in the amount of activation in these regions may reflect the greater perceptual differentiation required for recognizing natural objects. These findings are discussed in relation to category-specific impairments after neural damage.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brain function is altered in cognitively normal individuals at high risk for AD several years before the typical age at onset for this illness. BACKGROUND: Neuropathologic alterations in AD precede cognitive impairment by several years. It is unknown whether functional alterations in neural circuitry accompany these neuropathologic changes, and if so, whether they may be detectable before onset of symptoms. METHODS: We used functional MRI to compare cortical activation between two groups of cognitively normal women differing only in their risk for developing AD. Visual naming and letter fluency tasks were used to activate brain areas subserving object and face recognition, previously described sites of hypometabolism and neuropathologic alteration in AD. The risk groups differed in family history of AD and apolipoprotein E allele status, but were matched in age, education, and measures of cognitive performance. Average age of the study participants was 52 years. RESULTS: The regional patterns of brain activation were similar between groups. However, the high risk group showed areas of significantly reduced activation in the mid- and posterior inferotemporal regions bilaterally during both tasks despite identical naming and letter fluency performance. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitively normal individuals at high risk for AD demonstrate decreased brain activation in key areas engaged during naming and fluency tasks. Decreased activation in the high risk group may be a consequence of the presence of subclinical neuropathology in the inferotemporal region or in the inputs to that region. If so, these findings provide evidence of a window of opportunity for disease-modifying treatment before the onset of symptomatic AD.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to localize brain areas active during manipulation of complex objects. In one experiment subjects were required to manipulate complex objects for exploring their macrogeometric features as compared to manipulation of a simple smooth object (a sphere). In a second experiment subjects were asked to manipulate complex objects and to silently name them upon recognition as compared to manipulation of complex not recognizable objects without covert naming. Manipulation of complex objects resulted in an activation of ventral premotor cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 44], of a region in the intraparietal sulcus (most probably corresponding to the anterior intraparietal area in the monkey), of area SII and of a sector of the superior parietal lobule. When the objects were covertly named additional activations were found in the opercular part of BA 44 and in the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45). We suggest that a fronto-parietal circuit for manipulation of objects exists in humans and involves basically the same areas as in the monkey. It is proposed that area SII analyses the intrinsic object characteristics whilst the superior parietal lobule is related to kinaesthesia.

Abstract: A study on the biology of 'panic disorder,' which I have classified under the category of 'anxiety disorder,' made progress recently. In a genetic study, the hereditary of panic disorder was checked by a 'linkage and twins' study, and the anticipation of panic disorder was recognized as being the same as that which is also found in the psychiatric conditions known as schizophrenia and manic depression. A panic disorder patient regards the anxious sign of a model as ruinous, and this weakness in recognition has been duly noted. Therefore, I studied a patient showing a continuance state of 'hyper-sensitivity,' and compared this to a patient showing a 'sleep disorder.' Noradrenaline plays an important role in anxiety as suppression of the locus ceruleus (LN), the major NE-containing nucleus of the noradrenaline nervous system, brings on a calming effect. Yohimbine, however, which is an alpha 2 antagonist, is found to induce panic attacks. The fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) suppresses panic attacks suggests that serotonin is connected with panic disorders. It is also thought that the 'raphe nucleus' is the site of origin of the serotonin nervous system, which participates in the control of anxiety. This suggests the participation of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) nervous system in which the administration of benzodiazepine at a high potency would be an effective agent against panic disorder. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is also suggested to have a connection with panic disorder as CCK-4 causes panic attacks. There has been no CCK antagonist found effective for an object- or time-oriented panic disorder at the present. It is thought that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is released during a panic attack. The development of a new CRF receptor antagonist is needed. In addition to the studies on the neurotransmitters of the traditional type, such as noradrenaline, serotonin and GABA, studies on the neuropeptides, such as CCK and CRF have become important for future consideration. Understanding this, image studies such as MRI, SPECT, fMRI and PET have become highly desirable.

Abstract: Cortico-cortical projections for visual processing that originate from the striate cortex are organized into two streams. The dorsal stream projects to the parietal region and the ventral stream to the inferior temporal region. One hypothesis is that the dorsal stream processes visual spatial information, and the ventral stream processes visual object information. Although recognition of human faces or common objects has been shown preferentially to activate the ventral stream, the issue of when such processing starts to engage the ventral or the dorsal stream is not clear. The question explored in this study is whether processing of visual form per se without evoking the brain mechanisms that are associated with recognition of human faces or common objects is sufficient to activate the ventral stream more significantly relative to the condition when only visual spatial processing is involved. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while subjects performed a delayed comparison task in which either visual spatial or visual form information was processed. Cortical areas that were preferentially activated in visual spatial or visual form processing showed not only ventral-dorsal segregation, but also hemispheric laterality. The results extended previous findings by showing that preferential activation in the ventral pathway is not contingent upon such powerful stimuli as faces and common objects. Processing of simple visual form information is cause enough for such activation to be observed. A strong left hemisphere dominance in visual form recognition was also revealed. The observed laterality may be a reflection that the left hemisphere is more important in symbolic and/or semantic coding of visual form information.

Abstract: Brain imaging and electrophysiological recording studies in humans have reported discrete cortical regions in posterior ventral temporal cortex that respond preferentially to faces, buildings, and letters. These findings suggest a category-specific anatomically segregated modular organization of the object vision pathway. Here we present data from a functional MRI study in which we found three distinct regions of ventral temporal cortex that responded preferentially to faces and two categories of other objects, namely houses and chairs, and had a highly consistent topological arrangement. Although the data could be interpreted as evidence for separate modules, we found that each category also evoked significant responses in the regions that responded maximally to other stimuli. Moreover, each category was associated with its own differential pattern of response across ventral temporal cortex. These results indicate that the representation of an object is not restricted to a region that responds maximally to that object, but rather is distributed across a broader expanse of cortex. We propose that the functional architecture of the ventral visual pathway is not a mosaic of category-specific modules but instead is a continuous representation of information about object form that has a highly consistent and orderly topological arrangement.

Abstract: To investigate the contribution of the superior frontal gyrus and precuneus to the cognitive process of attention set shift, we examined the correlation between change in neural activity in these areas and the timing of attention set shift using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Seven subjects underwent a card-sorting task in which they matched a test card to one of two target cards according to color or shape. The subjects had to determine the correct category based only on feedback and shift the sorting principle when the feedback changed from "correct" to "incorrect." Transient increase of neural activity time locked with attention shift phases was detected in the medial superior frontal gyrus (the rostral part of the supplementary motor area) and precuneus. During the control task, in which the feedback and the motor responses were preserved without any attention shift, this type of change in neural activity was not observed. Our findings indicate that increase in neural activity in these brain areas may be closely related to attention set shift between object features and suggest that these areas may play a role in the shifting of cognitive sets.

Abstract: A large body of research in human perception and cognition has been concerned with the segregation of mental events into their presumed hierarchical processing stages, the temporal aspect of such processing being termed 'mental chronometry'. Advances in single-event functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have allowed the extraction of relative timing information between the onset of activity in different neural substrates as well as the duration of cognitive processing during a task, offering new opportunities in the study of human perception and cognition. Single-event fMRI studies have also facilitated increased spatial resolution in fMRI, allowing studies of columnar organization in humans. Important processes such as object recognition, binocular vision and other processes are thought to be organized at the columnar level; thus, these advances in the spatial and temporal capabilities of fMRI allow a new generation of cognitive and basic neuroscience studies to be performed, investigating the temporal and spatial relationships between these cortical sub-units. Such experiments bear a closer resemblance to single-unit or evoked-potential studies than to classical static brain activation maps and might serve as a bridge between primate electrophysiology and human studies. These advances are initially demonstrated only in simple visual and motor system tasks and it is likely to be several years before the techniques we describe are robust enough for general use.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) imaging was developed to provide both qualitative and quantitative information about an object or object system from images obtained with multiple modalities including digital radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasonography. Three-dimensional imaging operations may be classified under four basic headings: preprocessing, visualization, manipulation, and analysis. Preprocessing operations (volume of interest, filtering, interpolation, registration, segmentation) are aimed at extracting or improving the extraction of object information in given images. Visualization operations facilitate seeing and comprehending objects in their full dimensionality and may be either scene-based or object-based. Manipulation may be either rigid or deformable and allows alteration of object structures and of relationships between objects. Analysis operations, like visualization operations, may be either scene-based or object-based and deal with methods of quantifying object information. There are many challenges involving matters of precision, accuracy, and efficiency in 3D imaging. Nevertheless, 3D imaging is an exciting technology that promises to offer an expanding number and variety of applications.

Abstract: Until recently, the neural bases of visual object recognition in humans could be studied only by the use of brain-damaged subjects with naturally occurring lesions. Functional neuroimaging has given us the capability of studying visual recognition in the normal human brain. In the past ten years a number of PET and fMRI studies have attempted to isolate the neural substrates of human visual recognition. We have reviewed these studies and compared their conclusions regarding the anatomical locations of visual recognition processing in the human brain. The outcome was disappointing, revealing a wide range of locations. Our attempts to reduce the scatter by subgrouping the studies according to different task and stimulus properties were not successful. We discuss possible reasons for the lack of agreement among studies, including differences in the kinds of information yielded by lesion and imaging studies, and issues in the design and analysis of functional neuroimaging experiments. We conclude with a review of a more recent approach to the neuroimaging of human visual recognition, in which the effects of recognizing different types of visual stimuli are compared directly. With these experimental designs neuroimaging yields more replicable results, which also accord better with the known effects of lesions.

Abstract: We investigated the effects of repetition priming on the time course of recognition in several visual areas of the brain using fMRI. We slowed down recognition by gradually revealing the stimuli, in order to prolong the pre-recognition phase. Activation was lower for primed than for non-primed objects overall in both the occipitotemporal region (OTR) and the intraparietal region (IPR). A difference was found between primed and non-primed objects in the rate of increase of OTR activation. We concluded that the IPR, in addition to the OTR, was affected by repetition priming, and that this effect was different from that seen in the OTR.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To define further the brain regions involved in tactile object recognition using functional MRI (fMRI) techniques. BACKGROUND: The neural substrates involved in tactile object recognition (TOR) have not been elucidated. Studies of nonhuman primates and humans suggest that basic motor and somatosensory mechanisms are involved at a peripheral level; however, the mechanisms of higher order object recognition have not been determined. METHODS: The authors investigated 11 normal volunteers utilizing fMRI techniques in an attempt to determine the neural pathways involved in TOR. Each individual performed a behavioral paradigm with the activated condition involving identification of objects by touch, with identification of rough/smooth as the control. RESULTS: Data suggest that in a majority of individuals, TOR involves the calcarine and extrastriatal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus-polar region. CONCLUSIONS: TOR may utilize visual systems to access an internal object representation. The parietal cortices and inferior frontal regions may be involved in a concomitant lexical strategy of naming the object being examined. Frontal polar activation likely serves a role in visuospatial working memory or in recognizing unusual representations of objects. Overall, these findings suggest that TOR could involve a network of cortical regions subserving somatosensory, motor, visual, and, at times, lexical processing. The primary finding suggests that in this normal study population, the visual cortices may be involved in the topographic spatial processing of TOR.

Abstract: In this study a temporal titration method to explore the extent to which spatial memory is differentially impaired following right temporal lobectomy was employed. The spatial and non-spatial memory of 19 left and 19 right temporal lobectomy (TL) patients was compared with that of 16 normal controls. The subjects studied an array of 16 toy objects and were subsequently tested for object recall, object recognition and memory for the location of the objects. By systematically varying the retention intervals for each group, it was possible to match all three groups on object recall at sub-ceiling levels. When memory for the position of the objects was assessed at equivalent delays, the right TL group revealed disrupted spatial memory, compared with both left TL and control groups (P < 0.05). MRI was used to quantify the extent of temporal lobe resection in the two groups and a significant correlation between hippocampal removal and both recall of spatial location and object name recall in the right TL group only was shown. These data support the notion of a selective (but not exclusive) spatial memory impairment associated with right temporal lobe damage that is related to the integrity of the hippocampal functioning.

Abstract: The differential effect of stimulus inversion on face and object recognition suggests that inverted faces are processed by mechanisms for the perception of other objects rather than by face perception mechanisms. We investigated the face inversion using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The principal effect of face inversion on was an increased response in ventral extrastriate regions that respond preferentially to another class of objects (houses). In contrast, house inversion did not produce a similar change in face-selective regions. Moreover, stimulus inversion had equivalent, minimal effects for faces in in face-selective regions and for houses in house-selective regions. The results suggest that the failure of face perception systems with inverted faces leads to the recruitment of processing resources in object perception systems, but this failure is not reflected by altered activity in face perception systems.

Abstract: Two studies examined how the amount and type of computational demand are related to fMRI-measured activation in three bilateral cortical regions involved in the Shepard-Metzler (1971) mental-rotation paradigm. The amount of demand for the computation of visuospatial coordinates was manipulated by presenting mental rotation problems with increasing angular disparity (0, 40, 80, or 120 degrees). Activation in both the left and right intraparietal sulcal regions increased linearly with angular disparity in two separate studies. Activation also occurred in the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal regions, regions that are primarily associated with the processes of object and object-part identification. By contrast, the demand for object recognition and rotation processes was relatively low, and the demand for executing saccades was high in a control condition that required making a systematic visual scan of two grids. The grid-scanning condition resulted in relatively less activation in the parietal and inferior temporal regions but considerable activation in frontal areas that are associated with planning and executing saccades, including the precentral gyrus and sulcus into the posterior middle frontal region. These data suggest that the amount of activation in the various cortical regions that support visuospatial processing is related to the amount, as well as to the type, of computational demand.

Abstract: Recently there has been interest in an unusual neuropsychological disorder in which the patient copies a complex drawing in a position which is grossly rotated relative to the original. This disorder is of interest partly because of its relationship to current theories of the process of object recognition, but the range of performances typically seen, as well as its anatomical correlates, remain obscure. We report 16 cases who produced grossly rotated drawings of the Rey and Taylor Complex Figures. These patients were drawn from an unselected series of 240 cases, with a wide variety of lesion types and sites. The performances of the 16 patients displayed striking similarities. We describe the formal features of these drawings and plot their anatomical correlates.

Abstract: OBJECT: Functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging was performed in human volunteers to determine the lateral perisylvian cortical areas activated by innocuous cutaneous stimulation. METHODS: Eight volunteers who underwent 53 separate experiments form the basis of this report. Eight contiguous coronal slices were obtained using echoplanar fMR imaging techniques while participants were at rest and while somatosensory activation stimuli consisting of vibration or air puffs were delivered to various body areas. The data were analyzed using Student's t-test and cluster analysis to determine significant differences between the resting and activated states. The findings were as follows: the areas in the lateral cortex activated by the stimuli were the primary sensory cortex (SI), the second somatosensory area (SII), the insula, the superior parietal lobule, and the retroinsular parietal operculum (RIPO). Somatotopy was demonstrable in SI but not in the other areas identified. There was a surprisingly low correlation between the amount of cortex activated in the various areas, which could mean separate inputs and functions for the areas identified. The highest correlation was found between activity in SII and RIPO (0.69). CONCLUSIONS: The authors maintain that fMR imaging can be used to identify multiple lateral somatosensory areas in humans. Somatotopy is demonstrated in SI but not in the other lateral cortical sensory areas. The correlations between the amounts of cortex activated in the different lateral sensory areas are low. Recognition of the multiple lateral sensory areas is important both for understanding sensory cortical function and for safe interpretation of studies designed to identify the central sulcus by activating SI.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Autistic disorder is a developmental handicap with an unknown neurological basis. Current neuropsychological models for autism suggest an abnormal construction of visual perceptual representation or a deficit in executive functions. These models predict cerebral lesions in the temporo-occipital or frontal regions of autistic patients. The present study aimed at studying the presence of symptoms of autism and visual agnosia in a 13 year old girl who had a right temporo-occipital cortical dysplasia that was surgically removed at the age of 7. METHODS: Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler and Kaufman intelligence scales, a test of word fluency, digit span, Corsi block, California verbal learning, Trail making, Benton facial recognition, Snoodgrass object recognition tests, Rivermead face learning subtest, and developmental test of visual perception. The ADI-R was used to show current and retrospective diagnosis of autistic disorder. Neuroimagery included brain MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and PET. RESULTS: Brain MRI showed a right occipital defect and an abnormal hyperintensity of the right temporal cortex. PET and SPECT disclosed a left frontal hypometabolism together with the right occipital defect. Neuropsychological testing showed a visual apperceptive agnosia and executive function deficits. Psychiatric study confirmed the diagnosis of autistic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Although the possibility that autism and visual agnosia were dissociable factors in this patient cannot be excluded, the finding of both deficits supports the possibility that occipito-temporal lesions can predispose to the development of autism.

Abstract: Functional anatomical studies indicate that a set of neural signals in parietal and frontal cortex mediates the covert allocation of attention to visual locations across a wide variety of visual tasks. This frontoparietal network includes areas, such as the frontal eye field and supplementary eye field. This anatomical overlap suggests that shifts of attention to visual locations of objects recruit areas involved in oculomotor programming and execution. Finally, the fronto-parietal network may be the source of spatial attentional modulations in the ventral visual system during object recognition or discrimination.

Abstract: A typical scene contains many different objects, but the capacity of the visual system to process multiple stimuli at a given time is limited. Thus, attentional mechanisms are required to select relevant objects from among the many objects competing for visual processing. Evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans showed that when multiple stimuli are present simultaneously in the visual field, their cortical representations within the object recognition pathway interact in a competitive, suppressive fashion. Directing attention to one of the stimuli counteracts the suppressive influence of nearby stimuli. This mechanism may serve to filter out irrelevant information in cluttered visual scenes.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used in combined functional selectivity and retinotopic mapping tests to reveal object-related visual areas in the human occipital lobe. Subjects were tested with right, left, up, or down hemivisual field stimuli which were composed of images of natural objects (faces, animals, man-made objects) or highly scrambled (1,024 elements) versions of the same images. In a similar fashion, the horizontal and vertical meridians were mapped to define the borders of these areas. Concurrently, the same cortical sites were tested for their sensitivity to image-scrambling by varying the number of scrambled picture fragments (from 16-1,024) while controlling for the Fourier power spectrum of the pictures and their order of presentation. Our results reveal a stagewise decrease in retinotopy and an increase in sensitivity to image-scrambling. Three main distinct foci were found in the human visual object recognition pathway (Ungerleider and Haxby [1994]: Curr Opin Neurobiol 4:157-165): 1) Retinotopic primary areas V1-3 did not exhibit significant reduction in activation to scrambled images. 2) Areas V4v (Sereno et al., [1995]: Science 268:889-893) and V3A (De Yoe et al., [1996]: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93:2382-2386; Tootell et al., [1997]: J Neurosci 71:7060-7078) manifested both retinotopy and decreased activation to highly scrambled images. 3) The essentially nonretinotopic lateral occipital complex (LO) (Malach et al., [1995]: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:8135-8139; Tootell et al., [1996]: Trends Neurosci 19:481-489) exhibited the highest sensitivity to image scrambling, and appears to be homologous to macaque the infero-temporal (IT) cortex (Tanaka [1996]: Curr Opin Neurobiol 523-529). Breaking the images into 64, 256, or 1,024 randomly scrambled blocks reduced activation in LO voxels. However, many LO voxels remained significantly activated by mildly scrambled images (16 blocks). These results suggest the existence of object-fragment representation in LO.

Abstract: The extent to which primary visual cues such as motion or luminance are segregated in different cortical areas is a subject of controversy. To address this issue, we examined cortical activation in the human occipital lobe using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects performed a fixed visual task, object recognition, using three different primary visual cues: motion, texture, or luminance contrast. In the first experiment, a region located on the lateral aspect of the occipital lobe (LO complex) was preferentially activated in all 11 subjects both by luminance and motion-defined object silhouettes compared to full-field moving and stationary noise (ratios, 2.00+/-0.19 and 1.86+/-0.65, respectively). In the second experiment, all subjects showed enhanced activation in the LO complex to objects defined both by luminance and texture contrast compared to full-field texture patterns (ratios, 1.43+/-0.08 and 1.32+/-0.08, respectively). An additional smaller dorsal focus that exhibited convergence of object-related cues appeared to correspond to area V3a or a region slightly anterior to it. These results show convergence of visual cues in LO and provide strong evidence for its role in object processing.

Abstract: A brain-damaged patient is described whose pattern of performance provides insight into both the functional mechanisms and the neural structures involved in visual mental imagery. The patient became severely agnosic, alexic, achromatopsic and prosopagnosic following bilateral brain lesions in the temporo-occipital cortex. However, her mental imagery for the same visual entities that she could not perceive was perfectly preserved. This clear-cut dissociation held across all the major domains of high-level vision: object recognition, reading, colour and face processing. Our findings, together with other reports on domain-specific dissociations and functional brain imaging studies, provide evidence to support the view that visual perception and visual mental imagery are subserved by independent functional mechanisms, which do not share the same cortical implementation. In particular, our results suggest that mental imagery abilities need not be mediated by early visual cortices.

Abstract: We studied a patient who manifested a bilateral reading disorder through the somaesthetic modality, without deficit of elementary tactile sensation or tactile object naming, due to a left parietal infarct. Detailed investigation established the following points. (i) The patient showed normal function on elementary somaesthetic examination, normal function on high level tactile perception, except for minimal impairment of the right hand on the two-point discrimination test, and normal latencies on the somatosensory evoked potential in both hands. (ii) The patient had difficulty in reading letters using any somaesthetic strategy (graphaesthesia, directional joint kinaesthesia and active touch) with either hand. (iii) On a same-different judgement task, the patient's performance with the right hand was slightly defective on graphaesthesia and active touch, but performance with the left hand was within the normal range for all of the strategies. The patient's disorder was highly category specific and modality specific, indicating that somaesthetic letter reading can be disrupted not only independent of other high level somaesthetic functions, like object recognition, but also independent of other modes of reading functions, such as visual reading. A lesion involving the intraparietal sulcus, the upper part of the inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent white matter in the left hemisphere may be capable of compromising the pathways for somaesthetic letter reading with both hands.

Abstract: Echoplanar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to localize the cortical areas involved in the analysis of spatially transformed letter strings. Significant increases of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal for transformed vs normal reading were observed in the superior parietal lobule (SPL), along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in the frontal eye fields (FEF), and in the latero-occipital area LO. The respective contributions of oculomotor and spatial transformation areas to this activation pattern were separated by means of a control condition involving the execution and suppression of eye movements. Areas activated in association with the control of eye movements included the superior parietal lobule and the frontal eye fields. The cooperation of different brain areas was analysed by correlating the time course of task-dependent BOLD signal changes in these areas. This correlation analysis revealed coactivation of occipitotemporal object recognition areas and a spatial transformation area in the intraparietal sulcus during the reading of transformed letter strings. We suggest that cortical systems that are coactivated during complex cognitive tasks can be differentiated by the correlation analysis of BOLD signal time courses in spatially separate brain areas.

Abstract: Working memory is the process of actively maintaining a representation of information for a brief period of time so that it is available for use. In monkeys, visual working memory involves the concerted activity of a distributed neural system, including posterior areas in visual cortex and anterior areas in prefrontal cortex. Within visual cortex, ventral stream areas are selectively involved in object vision, whereas dorsal stream areas are selectively involved in spatial vision. This domain specificity appears to extend forward into prefrontal cortex, with ventrolateral areas involved mainly in working memory for objects and dorsolateral areas involved mainly in working memory for spatial locations. The organization of this distributed neural system for working memory in monkeys appears to be conserved in humans, though some differences between the two species exist. In humans, as compared with monkeys, areas specialized for object vision in the ventral stream have a more inferior location in temporal cortex, whereas areas specialized for spatial vision in the dorsal stream have a more superior location in parietal cortex. Displacement of both sets of visual areas away from the posterior perisylvian cortex may be related to the emergence of language over the course of brain evolution. Whereas areas specialized for object working memory in humans and monkeys are similarly located in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, those specialized for spatial working memory occupy a more superior and posterior location within dorsal prefrontal cortex in humans than in monkeys. As in posterior cortex, this displacement in frontal cortex also may be related to the emergence of new areas to serve distinctively human cognitive abilities.

Abstract: OBJECT: Spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage with development of the intracranial hypotension syndrome and acquired Chiari I malformation due to lumbar spinal CSF diversion procedures have both been well described. However, concomitant presentation of both syndromes has rarely been reported. The object of this paper is to present data in seven cases in which both syndromes were present. Three illustrative cases are reported in detail. METHODS: The authors describe seven symptomatic cases of spontaneous spinal CSF leakage with chronic intracranial hypotension syndrome in which magnetic resonance (MR) images depicted dural enhancement, brain sagging, loss of CSF cisterns, and acquired Chiari I malformation. CONCLUSIONS: This subtype of intracranial hypotension syndrome probably results from chronic spinal drainage of CSF or high-flow CSF shunting and subsequent loss of brain buoyancy that results in brain settling and herniation of hindbrain structures through the foramen magnum. Of 35 cases of spontaneous spinal CSF leakage identified in the authors' practice over the last decade, MR imaging evidence of acquired Chiari I malformation has been shown in seven. Not to be confused with idiopathic Chiari I malformation, ideal therapy requires recognition of the syndrome and treatment directed to the site of the spinal CSF leak.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: An extensive literature describes structural lesions in apraxia, but few studies have used functional neuroimaging. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to characterize relative cerebral glucose metabolism in a 65-year-old, right-handed woman with progressive decline in ability to manipulate objects, write, and articulate speech. OBJECTIVE: To characterize functional brain organization in apraxia. DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient underwent a neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET. The patient's magnetic resonance image was coregistered to her PET image, which was compared with the PET images of 7 right-handed, healthy controls. Hemispheric regions of interest were normalized by calcrine cortex. RESULTS: Except for apraxia and mild grip weakness, results of the neurological examination were normal. There was ideomotor apraxia of both hands (command, imitation, and object) and buccofacial apraxia. The patient could recognize meaningful gestures performed by the examiner and discriminate between his accurate and awkward pantomime. The magnetic resonance image showed moderate generalized atrophy and mild ischemic changes. Positron emission tomographic scans showed abnormal fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in the posterior frontal, supplementary motor, and parietal regions, the left affected more than the right. Focal metabolic deficit was present in the angular gyrus, an area hypothesized to store conceptual knowledge of skilled movement. CONCLUSIONS: Greater parietal than frontal physiological dysfunction and preserved gesture recognition are not consistent with the theory that knowledge of limb praxis is stored in the dominant parietal cortex. Gesture comprehension may be more diffusely distributed.

Abstract: We describe a patient (NJ), with a progressive visual disturbance, who showed an impairment in identifying larger visually-presented objects relative to their smaller counterparts. NJ showed this size effect for line drawings of objects, words and single letters. When presented with large letters comprised of smaller letters and asked to give speeded identification responses to either the large or small letters, NJ was grossly impaired at identifying the large letter. Additionally, when presented with a context meant to bias responding to either the large or small letter, NJ showed faster and more accurate responding in the small direction, but not in the large direction. We interpret these results as indicative of an impaired 'spotlight' of attention, which is deployed across the visual array, and is necessary for providing the selective visual attention responsible for the integration of visual features.

Abstract: A 30-year-old right-handed man (W.D.) with total callosal agenesis was examined neuropsychologically and with magnetic resonance imaging. Basic neuropsychological testing revealed normal intelligence and average attentional capabilities. Anatomically, W.D. shows strong leftward perisylvian asymmetry both for the planum temporale and planum parietale, an unusual pattern not found in our database of more than 200 brains of young and healthy individuals. Functionally, W.D. has strong right hand superiority for hand skill and tactile object recognition, indicating unusual left hemisphere dominance for both functions. Our observations could support the hypothesis that callosal connectivity and hemispheric asymmetry may be inversely related.

Abstract: Visual stimulus naming was studied in a 66-year-old male patient with optic aphasia subsequent to left occipito-temporal infarction. While having difficulty in naming objects perceived visually, he was able to name objects by viewing gestures illustrating their use, and to name actions shown in pictures. These results suggest that naming performance depends on the kind of stimulus that is visually presented (object vs. action). The present findings lend support to congnitive models which postulate the existence of visual and functional semantic systems.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent functional neuroimaging results implicate part of the ventral temporal lobe of the brain in face recognition, and have, together with neurophysiological findings, been used as evidence for a face-specific neural module in the brain. Experimental designs, however, have often failed to distinguish between the class of the object used as the stimulus (face or non-face) and the level of categorization at which the stimulus is recognized (the 'basic' level, such as 'bird', at which familiar objects are first recognized, or more subordinate levels - 'sparrow', for example - which require additional perceptual processing). We have used echo-planar functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activation for the matching of non-face objects with subordinate-level and basic-level descriptors. RESULTS: The additional visual processing required to verify the subordinate level of a picture over its basic level was associated with activation of the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri (FIT) as well as the temporal poles. These areas correspond closely to those previously implicated in the processing of facial images. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that areas of the ventral visual pathway that have been associated with face recognition are sensitive to manipulations of the categorization level of non-face objects. This idea offers an alternative to the dominant view that FIT may be organized according to conceptual categories, and our results establish the importance of manipulating task requirements when evaluating a 'neural module' hypothesis.

Abstract: Motion and deformation analysis of the myocardium are of utmost interest in cardiac imaging. Part of the, research is devoted to the estimation of the heart function by analysis of the shape changes of the left-ventricular endocardial surface. However, most clinically used shape-based approaches are often two-dimensional (2-D) and based on the analysis of the shape at only two cardiac instants. Three-dimensional (3-D) approaches generally make restrictive hypothesis about the actual endocardium motion to be able to recover a point-to-point correspondence between two surfaces. The present work is a first step toward the automatic spatio-temporal analysis and recognition of deformable surfaces. A curvature-based and easily interpretable description of the surfaces is derived. Based on this description, shape dynamics is first globally estimated through the temporal shape spectra. Second, a regional curvature-based tracking approach is proposed assuming a smooth deformation. It combines geometrical and spatial information in order to analyze a specific endocardial region. These methods are applied both on true 3-D X-ray data and on simulated normal and abnormal left ventricles. The results are coherent and easily interpretable. Shape dynamics estimations and comparisons between deformable object sequences are now possible through these techniques. This promising framework is a suitable tool for a complete regional description of deformable surfaces.

Abstract: We present a case of retrosplenial amnesia following an infarction in the right retrosplenial region. A 62-year-old male showed mild weakness of the left hand, dizziness and gait disturbance. He also noticed that he could not perceive objects that he saw as real, but could perceive an object as real only by touching it. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum and retrosplenial region on the right side. There was no aphasia or apraxia, but mild topographic disturbance was present. Intelligence was normal, but amnesia was noted. Both verbal and visual memory were disturbed equally. This case suggests that memory plays a role in the right retrosplenial region.

Abstract: The ability to recognize elements of the environment as familiar objects, events, or classes underlies virtually all human cognition. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the recognition of visually presented objects suggest that several brain areas crucially support this function. However, a review of these findings reveals great variability in the cortical localization of object recognition in humans. Although there is converging evidence for the importance of the temporal and occipitotemporal cortex in object recognition, a consistent picture of the functional organization within these areas and their relation to function in other cortical regions has not yet emerged from brain imaging studies.

Abstract: This paper describes a computer-aided procedure for creating a surface model on the basis of pattern recognition in images produced by nuclear spin tomography. A local search algorithm that recognizes the entire profile of the relevant object starting from a point determined (input) by the user is described. The pattern (structure) thus recognized is approximated by a mathematical description. By including the adjacent layers, a surface model can be generated. The main focus is on the rapid identification of the pattern and the prior preparation of the data used as input for the surface model. The human shoulder serves as an example to verify the approach.

Abstract: Somaesthetic, motor and cognitive functions were studied in a man with impaired tactile object-recognition (TOR) in his left hand due to a right parietal convexity meningeoma which had been surgically removed. Primary motor and somatosensory functions were not impaired, and discriminative abilities for various tactile aspects and cognitive skills were preserved. Nevertheless, the patient could often not appreciate the object's nature or significance when it was placed in his left hand and was unable to name or to describe or demonstrate the use of these objects. Therefore, he can be regarded as an example of associative tactile agnosia. The view is taken and elaborated that defective modality-specific meaning representations account for associative tactile agnosia. These meaning representations are conceptualized as learned unimodal feature-entity relationships which are thought to be defective in tactile agnosia. In line with this hypothesis, tactile feature analysis and cross-modal matching of features were largely preserved in the investigated patient, while combining features to form entities was defective in the tactile domain. The alternative hypothesis of agnosia as deficit of cross-modal association of features was not supported. The presumed distributed functional network responsible for TOR is thought to involve perception of features, object recognition and related tactile motor behaviour interactively. A deficit leading primarily to impaired combining features to form entities can therefore be expected to result in additional minor impairment of related perceptual-motor processes. Unilaterality of the gnostic deficit can be explained by a lateralized organization of the functional network responsible for tactile recognition of objects.

Abstract: We report a case of multiple sclerosis with visual form agnosia and callosal syndromes. Initially, the patient's visual recognition of object form was severely disturbed at the perceptual stage, in association with left-sided ideomotor apraxia and agraphia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed large white matter lesions in the bilateral frontal and occipital lobes, the latter extending to the occipitotemporal junction, and widespread corpus callosum lesions. Over the course of one year follow-up, neuropsychological examinations indicated that the patient's visual recognition defects occurred not only at the early substage of form perception, but also at the stage of reproducing the shape of objects from visual memory store. The present case suggests that neural connections between the striate cortex and occipitotemporal visual areas are crucial for both the perceptual and associative stages of visual object recognition.

Abstract: In a series of experimental investigations of a subject with a unilateral impairment of tactile object recognition without impaired tactile sensation, several issues were addressed. First, is tactile agnosia secondary to a general impairment of spatial cognition? On tests of spatial ability, including those directed at the same spatial integration process assumed to be taxed by tactile object recognition, the subject performed well, implying a more specific impairment of high level, modality specific tactile perception. Secondly, within the realm of high level tactile perception, is there a distinction between the ability to derive shape ('what') and spatial ('where') information? Our testing showed an impairment confined to shape perception. Thirdly, what aspects of shape perception are impaired in tactile agnosia? Our results indicate that despite accurate encoding of metric length and normal manual exploration strategies, the ability tactually to perceive objects with the impaired hand, deteriorated as the complexity of shape increased. In addition, asymmetrical performance was not found for other body surfaces (e.g. her feet). Our results suggest that tactile shape perception can be disrupted independent of general spatial ability, tactile spatial ability, manual shape exploration, or even the precise perception of metric length in the tactile modality.

Abstract: The intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) is used to evaluate memory function preoperatively in candidates for anterior temporal lobe resections (ATL). We examined IAP memory asymmetry scores in 30 patients undergoing ATL (17 R, 13 L), as a function of the presence (HS+) or absence (HS-) of hippocampal sclerosis. Ictal onset zones were determined by extraoperative recording with subdural strip electrodes in all but 3 patients in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed HS. MRI scans were otherwise normal. All patients were left hemisphere dominant for language except 1, in whom language was represented bilaterally. IAP memory testing involved presentation of eight subjects during anesthesia of each hemisphere, followed by recognition testing after patients recovered from amobarbital effects. A score of 1 was given for each correctly recognized object, and 0.5 was deducted for each false-positive identification. There were 16 foils. A total asymmetry score was calculated, which was positive if there was agreement between the direction of the symmetry and side of operation and negative if reversed. The mean asymmetry score for HS- (n = 8) was 0.9; that for HS+ (n = 22) was 4.1 (p < 0.01). IAP memory performance provided lateralizing information (asymmetry score > or = + or -2) in 73% of cases; among these, the lateralization was correct in 91%. Our data indicate that IAP memory asymmetry predicts both laterality of ictal onset and the presence of HS.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ability to name objects depends partly on visual perception. We used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure activity-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow (r-CBF) in order to identify regions of the brain activated during visual object naming. METHODS: Four right-handed volunteers were recruited. Following an intravenous injection of 15O-labeled water, r-CBF was measured during visual object naming, counting numbers, and resting. PET and MRI images were coregistered, the size of the brain was proportionally adjusted in each axis to Talairach's and Tournoux's atlas, and the comparison of stimulated versus resting blood flow images revealed activated brain regions. RESULTS: In the subtraction of resting from naming, activation was observed in the bilateral primary visual cortex, bilateral fusiform gyrus, left lingual gyrus, bilateral inferotemporal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, left parietal operculum, and left putamen. In the subtraction of counting from naming, most of the those areas were activated, but no significant activity was observed in the left lingual gyrus, left parietal operculum, or bilateral precentral gyrus (motor cortex). The areas activated with the paradigm included those dedicated to visual perception (primary and associate visual cortex), visual recognition (inferior temporal cortex), and phonological output (Broca's area). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the major neural network from occipital lobe to frontal cortex, which is mainly involved in the ventral visual pathway, demonstrated activation in these tasks. Result of this study will serve as base line data for analyzing the findings in patients with impaired visual perception.

Abstract: The stages of integration leading from local feature analysis to object recognition were explored in human visual cortex by using the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here we report evidence for object-related activation. Such activation was located at the lateral-posterior aspect of the occipital lobe, just abutting the posterior aspect of the motion-sensitive area MT/V5, in a region termed the lateral occipital complex (LO). LO showed preferential activation to images of objects, compared to a wide range of texture patterns. This activation was not caused by a global difference in the Fourier spatial frequency content of objects versus texture images, since object images produced enhanced LO activation compared to textures matched in power spectra but randomized in phase. The preferential activation to objects also could not be explained by different patterns of eye movements: similar levels of activation were observed when subjects fixated on the objects and when they scanned the objects with their eyes. Additional manipulations such as spatial frequency filtering and a 4-fold change in visual size did not affect LO activation. These results suggest that the enhanced responses to objects were not a manifestation of low-level visual processing. A striking demonstration that activity in LO is uniquely correlated to object detectability was produced by the "Lincoln" illusion, in which blurring of objects digitized into large blocks paradoxically increases their recognizability. Such blurring led to significant enhancement of LO activation. Despite the preferential activation to objects, LO did not seem to be involved in the final, "semantic," stages of the recognition process. Thus, objects varying widely in their recognizability (e.g., famous faces, common objects, and unfamiliar three-dimensional abstract sculptures) activated it to a similar degree. These results are thus evidence for an intermediate link in the chain of processing stages leading to object recognition in human visual cortex.

Abstract: An object's global, three-dimensional structure may be represented by a specialized brain system involving regions of inferior temporal cortex. This system's role in object representation can be understood by experiments in which people study drawings of novel objects with possible or impossible three-dimensional structures, and later make either possible/impossible object decisions or old/new recognition decisions about briefly flashed studied and non-studied objects. Although object decisions about possible objects are facilitated by prior study, there is no corresponding facilitation for impossible objects, thereby implicating a system that is specifically involved in the representation of structurally coherent visual objects. Here we show, by positron emission tomography (PET), that increases in blood flow in inferior temporal regions are associated with object decisions about possible but not impossible objects, and that there are increases in the vicinity of the hippocampal formation associated with episodic recognition of possible objects.

Abstract: Evoked potentials to visually driven cognitive tasks were recorded through depth electrodes placed bilaterally within the amygdala, hippocampus, midtemporal and inferotemporal cortex, and lateral frontal cortex of 6 epileptic patients. Task-related differential response patterns were used to identify the recording sites engaged by specific aspects of visual encoding. In this group of 6 patients, the amygdala was most frequently engaged in encoding the familiarity of faces; midtemporal and inferotemporal cortex, in encoding perceptual identity and object categorization; and lateral frontal cortex, in holding visual object information in working memory. The two aspects of encoding that most frequently engaged the hippocampal region were related to working memory and object categorization. The processing of complex visual knowledge is thus anatomically distributed but regionally specialized. These experiments also showed that identical input and output parameters can engage different areas of the brain depending on the nature of the instructional set.

Abstract: Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception. He is also impaired at recognizing objects presented from unconventional views, but recognition of prototypical views of objects, and color and form discrimination are normal, as is his ability to recognize faces. The anatomical characteristics of the lesions of these two patients permit a direct experimental comparison of the effects of lesions confined to the parietal or temporal pathways. E.W.'s and A.F.'s performance on the psychophysical and neuropsychological tasks discussed here supports the functional distinction between a dorsal and a ventral extrastriate system but additionally suggests the existence of a pathway involved in identification-from-motion that is separate from both the dorsal early motion/spatial analysis pathway and the ventral color/static-form pathway.

Abstract: A chronic tactile agnosic with a small, MRI-documented left inferior parietal infarction underwent detailed somesthetic testing to assess (1) the acquisition of sensory data, (2) the manipulation of somatosensory percept and its association with previous knowledge, and (3) recognition occurring at a deeper taxonomic level. Results suggest that tactile agnosia can arise from faulty high-level perceptual processes, but that the ability to associate tactually defined objects and object parts with episodic memory can be preserved. Consistent with anatomic and physiologic studies in nonhuman primates, inferior parietal cortex (including Brodmann area 40, possibly area 39) appears to serve as a high-level somatosensory region.

Abstract: We report our observations on praxis in a strongly right-handed man following a massive stroke that resulted in virtually complete destruction of the left cerebral hemisphere. Our patient was severely impaired in pantomiming transitive gestures with the left hand and in reproducing novel non-symbolic hand and arm movement sequences. However, overlearned habitual actions like actual object use and intransitive gestures were relatively spared. Performance of axial commands was intact. Gesture recognition and discrimination were also preserved. Based on these findings, we propose that the praxis system of the right hemisphere is strongly biased toward "concrete" or context-dependent execution of familiar, well-established action routines. The right hemisphere is critically dependent on transcallosal contribution from the left hemisphere for control of the left hand in "abstract" or context-independent performance of transitive movements and in learning novel movement sequences. At least in some individuals, the right hemisphere can recognize and discriminate gestures. Possible implications of our findings for the cerebral control of praxis and for recovery from apraxia are discussed.

Abstract: This study had three general points. First, it examined possible visual consequences of frontal lesions. A patient with focal damage to the subcortical regions of the left frontal lobe, and a small amount of damage near Broca's area, was predicted to have impaired brain function in posterior regions that are anatomically connected to the damaged site. Second, it showed the utility of using positron emission tomography (PET) in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize "functional lesions." PET revealed reduced metabolism in posterior cortical loci that are innervated by fibers from the damaged regions. Some of the affected areas are hypothesized to be involved in visual functions, specifically the encoding of lines and edges. Third, a series of tests was designed to document that the patient had difficulty encoding visual stimuli, and then to distinguish among alternative possible causes of this deficit. The results suggested that the patient encoded shapes as sets of filled locations if possible, which allowed him to use intact processes subserved by brain areas that were not affected by the damage. The data were best explained if the lesion slowed processing in the ventral system (which encodes object properties), allowing the dorsal system (which encodes spatial properties) to produce a response more quickly than the ventral system.

Abstract: Following a thoracic trauma, which caused brain hypoxia, a 24-year-old man presented with a dense retrograde amnesia for events, persons and environments that spanned his whole life before injury. Knowledge acquired at school or through the media were equally lost, with the exception of arithmetical skills and some geographical knowledge. No deficit was apparent in language, object recognition, motor skills and intellectual tests. Anterograde memory was marked by very efficient learning capacity, an almost perfect retention of information at delay interval of 4 hours and pathologically rapid forgetting at longer delays. Informal observations agreed with test performance in showing that he could relearn facts of the past and easily acquire new information, but tended to lose these memories if the information was not frequently rehearsed. PET showed a hypometabolism of the posterior temporal lobes. Though some points remain obscure, we propose that a consolidation deficit hypothesis provides the most sensible interpretation of this peculiar pattern of memory deficit.

Abstract: Five somatosensory cortices have distinctive somatotopic representations, cytoarchitecture, and connectivity: primary somatosensory cortex (SI), ventrolateral association cortices (SII, SIII, and SIV), and dorsomedial association cortex (supplementary sensory area). Patients with focal lesions of ventrolateral (n = 5) and dorsomedial (n = 6) somatosensory association cortices (SACs) and hemiparetic (n = 8) and neurologically normal control patients (n = 14) underwent detailed somesthetic testing that encompassed basic, intermediate, and complex (tactile object recognition) somesthetic functions. Dorsomedial lesions acutely caused severe disruption of somesthetic processing and severe apraxia when the area of damage was extensive and involved anterior and posterior cortices. In contrast, ventrolateral lesions caused tactile agnosia. Chronically, sensorimotor function following dorsomedial damage improved considerably. Tactile agnosia following ventrolateral damage, however, was readily detectable for years following onset. Functional differences between ventrolateral and dorsomedial SACs may reflect parallel processing in dual somatosensory systems.

Abstract: Studies of brain-damaged patients have revealed the existence of a selective impairment of face processing, prosopagnosia, resulting from lesions at different loci in the occipital and temporal lobes. The results of such studies have led to the identification of several cortical areas underlying the processing of faces, but it remains unclear what functional aspects of face processing are served by these areas and whether they are uniquely devoted to the processing of faces. The present study addresses these questions in a positron emission tomography (PET) study of regional cerebral blood flow in normal adults, using the 15 oxygen water bolus technique. The subjects participated in six tasks (with gratings, faces and objects), and the resulting level of cerebral activation was mapped on images of the subjects' cerebral structures obtained through magnetic resonance and was compared between tasks using the subtraction method. Compared with a fixation condition, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes were found in the striate and extrastriate cortex when subjects had to decide on the orientation of sine-wave gratings. A face-gender categorization resulted in activation changes in the right extrastriate cortex, and a face-identity condition produced additional activation of the fusiform gyrus and anterior temporal cortex of both hemispheres, and of the right parahippocampal gyrus and adjacent areas. Cerebral activation during an object-recognition task occurred essentially in the left occipito-temporal cortex and did not involve the right hemisphere regions specifically activated during the face-identity task. The results provide the first empirical evidence from normal subjects regarding the crucial role of the ventro-medial region of the right hemisphere in face recognition, and they offer new information about the dissociation between face and object processing.

Abstract: Simultanagnosia is a disorder of visual perception characterized by the inability to interpret complex visual arrays despite preserved recognition of single objects. We report a series of investigations on a simultanagnosic patient which attempt to establish the nature of this visual processing disturbance. The patient performed normally on a feature detection task but was impaired on a test of attention-requiring visual search in which she was asked to distinguish between stimuli containing different numbers of targets. She was not impaired on a visual-spatial orienting task. She identified single briefly presented words and objects as rapidly and reliably as controls suggesting that access to stored structural descriptions was not impaired. With brief, simultaneous presentation of 2 words or drawings, she identified both stimuli significantly more frequently when the stimuli were semantically related than when they were unrelated. On the basis of these and other data, we suggest that the patient's simultanagnosia is attributable to an impairment in the process by which activated structural descriptions are linked to information coding the location of the object.

Abstract: Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man.

Abstract: A 61-year-old right-handed man fell downstairs and was found unconscious. There was no abnormality in the general physical examinations. Neurological examinations revealed a quadrantanopia. Neuropsychological examination revealed an impairment in recent verbal memory, alexia, agraphia, object agnosia, color naming difficulty, prosopagnosia, and visuospatial constructional disability. CT scan demonstrated subcortical hematomas in the temporo-occipital regions of both hemispheres. MRI demonstrated extensive low-intensity lesions in the lingual, fusiform and posterior inferior temporal gyri on both hemispheres. Both inferior longitudinal fasciculi were also affected. His neuropsychological deficits seem best described as a typical form of associative visual agnosia. From the results of neuroradiological findings, the authors emphasize that associative visual agnosia might be produced by an intrahemispheric disconnection between the visual cortices and the temporal lobes which are supposed to be the storage site of the engrams of visual memories. Moreover, the neuropsychological findings suggest that the visuo-constructional ability to convert the two-dimensional input to the three-dimensional construction and the capacity of three-dimensional imagination were severely impaired in our patient. It was considered that these neuropsychological features play an important role in the recognition difficulties of associative visual agnosia.
